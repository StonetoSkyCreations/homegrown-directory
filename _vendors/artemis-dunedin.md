  A Dunedin-based natural health company producing certified organic herbal medicines, using sustainably harvested and globally sourced medicinal plants.
long_description: |
  Artemis is a natural health products company founded in 1998 and headquartered in Dunedin, New Zealand. The business specialises in the manufacture of traditional plant-based medicines, including herbal teas, creams, oils, oral liquids, and health tonics. Artemis is not a food-producing farm, but a producer of therapeutic herbal remedies.

  The company works with certified organic, wildcrafted, and sustainably harvested medicinal plants. A key ingredient is Central Otago thyme, which Artemis harvests and extracts themselves using sustainable wildcrafting methods. Other herbs are sourced from New Zealand growers and international regions where specific plants grow best, all aligned with organic and quality standards.

  Artemis emphasises kaitiakitanga, combining traditional herbal knowledge with modern scientific research. They collaborate with organisations such as Plant & Food Research at the University of Otago and engage with growers and projects around New Zealand to increase local sourcing of medicinal plants.

  Products are sold through health shops, pharmacies, and online channels across New Zealand. Manufacturing and warehousing are contracted within New Zealand, while governance and product development are managed from their Dunedin head office.
