long_description: >
  Wybalena Organic Farm is a 170-acre retreat property located in The Pocket, within the Byron Bay hinterland. The land was historically used for dairy farming and later for bananas, coffee, and vegetables. The current owner and founder, Julian, together with his brother, reimagined the property as a place dedicated to deep rest, refuge, and reconnection with nature.

  The name Wybalena is an Aboriginal word meaning resting place or refuge, reflecting the intention behind the farm’s evolution. The venue operates as an exclusive-use retreat space, hosting private groups of up to 22 guests at a time to maintain a quiet, contained, and peaceful environment.

  The farm is managed using organic permaculture principles, with a strong emphasis on soil health, clean water, and biodiversity. Bore water is drawn from the property and filtered to support balanced pH levels. The landscape includes spring-fed creeks, dams, bushland, and productive areas planted with diverse fruit trees that guests are welcome to harvest from during their stay.

  Livestock is integrated into the system through a small herd of pasture-raised beef cattle that contribute to land management, along with chickens fed on kitchen scraps. These systems support closed-loop nutrient cycling and low-impact land care.

  Wellness infrastructure includes a magnesium swimming pool, infrared sauna, and an ice bath, alongside architecturally designed accommodation, a professional-grade kitchen, and a dedicated yoga and movement hall. Guests are offered complimentary guided walks of the private nature trails, led by the on-site farm manager, to learn about the land, its history, and ecological systems.

  Wybalena Organic Farm also maintains community connections by supporting local initiatives and charities, and by making infrastructure available for community use. The retreat operates as a place for rest, learning, and immersion in organic land stewardship.
