Selwyn Organics Co-op is a volunteer-run group based in Rolleston that works together to make certified organic, spray-free and natural goods accessible to its members. Operating for over a decade, the co-op coordinates bulk orders of organic dry goods and produce for collection by local households. Members can order staples such as flour, nuts, dried fruit and pantry items, as well as seasonal vegetables from suppliers like Streamside Organics. Communication and order cycles are managed through email and a private group, and the co-op emphasises affordability and community connection.
