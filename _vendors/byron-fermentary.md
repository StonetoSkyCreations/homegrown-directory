long_description: >
  Byron Fermentary is a regenerative fermentary located at The Farm at Byron Bay in Ewingsdale, New South Wales. Founded by chef Katerina Lazareva, the business was established as a response to industrial, chemical-reliant food systems and as a return to ancestral food preservation practices.

  The fermentary is deeply influenced by Katerina’s family history. Her grandparents, exiled to Kazakhstan in the 1950s, relied on traditional farming, fermentation, and preservation techniques for survival. These methods now form the foundation of Byron Fermentary’s approach to food production.

  Operating as a closed-loop system, Byron Fermentary is designed to eliminate food waste. Vegetables grown or sourced for primary ferments such as kimchi generate off-cuts, which are then transformed into secondary products including tonics, salts, and miso using fermentation techniques such as koji. Any remaining organic matter is composted and returned to the soil, completing the nutrient cycle.

  Most ingredients are grown on-site within a regenerative market garden at The Farm at Byron Bay. The garden uses diverse plantings and natural pest management strategies to improve soil health, increase biodiversity, and support carbon capture. When additional produce is required, it is sourced from local certified organic growers who follow aligned ecological practices.

  Byron Fermentary also offers education as part of its mission. Through in-person workshops and an online platform, All Things Cultured, the business shares fermentation knowledge and skills with the wider community, supporting a deeper understanding of food preservation, waste reduction, and regenerative systems.
