long_description: 'Sunshine Gelato is an Auckland-based gelato maker founded by Nathan Gutsell and Mulan Zhang, created with a simple intention: to make joyful treats using real, organic ingredients without artificial additives or preservatives. Their menu includes traditional gelato made with organic A2 milk, vegan coconut-based cocolato, fruit sorbets, popolatos, fresh hot waffles, and smoothies - all designed to cater to a wide range of dietary needs including vegan, gluten-free, halal-suitable, and sugar-free options.


  Originally launched as Lalele Organic Gelato in 2011, the business grew through night markets, farmers'' markets, and community events before establishing a permanent indoor stall at Catalina Bay Farmers Market in Hobsonville Point. Sunshine Gelato now operates a vintage caravan and a full food truck, catering for school galas, festivals, fundraisers, film crews, and corporate events. At its core, Sunshine Gelato is about honest ingredients, thoughtful preparation, and offering treats families can genuinely feel good about.
