long_description: |
  Coffee LaLa has been roasting coffee on the Coromandel since 2002, combining deep technical knowledge with a hands-on, origin-led approach to flavour. Each coffee origin is roasted individually to suit its unique soil, climate, and character, before being carefully blended into complex, balanced, award-winning coffees. Their beans are 100% Arabica, sourced from respected plantations around the world and handled with precision at every stage of roasting.

  Beyond retail coffee, Coffee LaLa supplies cafés, bakeries, and mobile carts across the Coromandel and beyond, offering not just coffee but full support — from commercial machine sourcing to setup, maintenance, and staff training. Nationwide delivery makes their coffee accessible throughout Aotearoa, with a strong emphasis on reliability, service, and long-term relationships. At its core, Coffee LaLa is about more than great coffee — it’s about consistency, care, and doing the craft properly.
