  A New Zealand organic dairy brand producing certified organic milk powders from grass-fed cows, sourced from dedicated organic farms in Southland.
long_description: |
  AwaRua Organics is an organic dairy brand owned by Open Country Dairy, producing certified organic milk powders from milk sourced exclusively from a dedicated group of organic farms in the Awarua region of Southland. While brand administration is based in Auckland, all milk collection and processing occurs close to the farms at the Awarua dairy facility.

  The brand works with approximately 15 long-term partner farms that have completed a two-year conversion process to certified organic production. Cows are pasture-raised and grass-fed year-round in Southland’s temperate climate, living outdoors and foraging naturally. Organic farming standards prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilisers, antibiotics, additives, or preservatives.

  AwaRua Organics emphasises animal welfare, soil health, water protection, and farmer wellbeing. Pasture-based systems are supported with organic forage crops when required, and milk is processed within hours of collection to preserve quality and safety. All products are made from 100 percent New Zealand–sourced organic milk, with some lines using certified organic A2 protein milk.

  Products are sold directly to consumers online and distributed to domestic and international markets, including Australia, China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.
