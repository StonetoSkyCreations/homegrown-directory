long_description: Situated on the wharf at Catalina Bay, Hobsonville Point, this covered farmers' market is open from 8:30 am to 2 pm every Saturday and Sunday. The market brings together local growers and artisan producers selling farm-fresh fruit and vegetables, bread, meat, cheese, organic goods, coffee, honey and flowers, as well as ready-to-eat food stalls. Live music and waterfront views create a relaxed atmosphere, and the market's undercover setting means it operates rain or shine. There is ample parking nearby and visitors can enjoy breakfast or brunch, stock up on groceries or browse handmade crafts. The market team welcomes applications from new stallholders and encourages shoppers to bring their own bags to reduce waste.
