long_description: |
  The Coromandel Mountains Tea Tree Oil Company has been harvesting wild manuka and kanuka on its 360‑acre farm in Whitianga for over 25 years. The farm is certified organic by BioGro New Zealand and the owners hand‑pick the foliage and distil essential oils using minimal processing to retain the plants’ therapeutic qualities. Products include 100% pure manuka and kanuka oil and handmade soaps that are supplied to health stores around New Zealand. Although not a food producer, the farm contributes to the region’s sustainable land use by protecting native tea tree stands and operating chemical‑free. Customers can purchase oils online or by contacting the business via email.
