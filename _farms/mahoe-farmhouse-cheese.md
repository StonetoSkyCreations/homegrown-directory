description: Family-run farmhouse cheesery in the Bay of Islands producing award-winning artisan cheeses using milk from their own pasture-raised cows.
long_description: 'Mahoe Farmhouse Cheese is a family-owned cheesery located near Kerikeri in the Bay of Islands, producing artisan cheeses on site since 1986. The operation is built around a closed-loop model: a small mixed-breed herd grazes the surrounding pastures, and milk flows directly from each milking into the cheese vats, ensuring freshness, traceability, and minimal environmental impact.


  Mahoe specialises in traditional Dutch-style cheeses such as Gouda, Edam, and Blue, alongside fresh styles including feta, halloumi-style Volcanic cheese, quark, and yoghurt. The cows are 100% grass-fed, with no grain or palm kernel supplements, and animal welfare is central to the farm''s ethos, including low stocking rates and avoiding the bobby calf system. Cheesemaking is done by hand in small batches using vegetarian rennet, combining traditional techniques with continual refinement - an approach that has earned Mahoe Cheese numerous national awards and recognition from chefs, retailers, and farmers'' market customers across Aotearoa.
