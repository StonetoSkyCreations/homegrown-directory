  Rockwall Farm is a long-established family farm operated by Nicole and Monty Dayman in the Byron Bay hinterland. The farm began over twenty years ago as a small homestead and has evolved into a certified organic operation grounded in ethical, regenerative, and permaculture-based principles.

  From the outset, Rockwall Farm has operated spray-free, focusing on nurturing soil health, biodiversity, and community connection. In 2018, the farm formalised its practices through organic certification with Southern Cross Organic. Livestock and cropping systems are managed to support long-term soil regeneration, with regular pasture rotation, green manure cover crops, and inter-planting to reduce pest pressure naturally.

  The farm grows a wide variety of produce including garlic, ginger, turmeric, citrus, vegetables, flowers, and herbs, alongside small-batch products such as dried citrus, rosella tea, and turmeric and ginger juice refreshers. A strong emphasis is placed on biodiversity, including large-scale native rainforest restoration planting to support the Big Scrub ecosystem.

  Rockwall Farm also operates a trust-based roadside honesty box, offering seasonal produce directly to the local community. Animal welfare is managed with low-stress handling and pasture-based systems designed to support calm, healthy animals without synthetic inputs.
