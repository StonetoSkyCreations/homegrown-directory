Kiwi Harbour Farm is a fictional family-run property overlooking the bays of
Te Pātaka o Rākaihautū / Banks Peninsula. The growers focus on soil-building
through diverse cover crops, managed grazing, and compost-made-on-farm. Weekly
produce boxes feature seasonal vegetables and heritage fruit, and visitors can
book educational tours to see how water, biodiversity, and animal welfare are
protected on the land.
