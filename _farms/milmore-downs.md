Milmore Downs is a 302-hectare, third-generation biodynamic and certified organic farm in the Scargill Valley, north of Christchurch. Managed by the family team of Matthew, Alice, Ian and Eva, the farm integrates mixed cropping with livestock to build long-term soil fertility. Dinkel/spelt, wheat, rye, and barley are grown in rotation alongside deep-rooted herbal leys grazed by sheep and cattle, creating a resilient, self-renewing system.

The farm produces its own biodynamic preparations, maintains extensive shelter planting, and uses a flood-harvest irrigation system to optimise water resilience. All grain products are milled in small batches on Zentrofan mills to preserve freshness and nutrient density. Milmore Downs supplies home bakers, cafés, restaurants, and customers seeking certified organic, minimally processed grains grown with integrity.
