long_description: |
  Ahikaaroa Trust Farm is a Māori-led whenua development and organic farming initiative based in the Kaitaia region of Northland. Operating under Te Ahikaaroa Trust, the project combines certified organic food production with permaculture design, natural building, and social housing development on Māori land.

  The trust’s work is grounded in the principles of kaitiakitanga and tino rangatiratanga, supporting whānau to reconnect with land through sustainable food systems and healthy housing. Organic farming practices are integrated with permaculture planning, alongside rammed earth construction methods used for eco-friendly, three-bedroom homes developed through Kāinga Whenua loan pathways.

  In addition to growing seasonal organic produce, Ahikaaroa Trust Farm provides education and skills training in permaculture, land stewardship, and natural building techniques. The project aims to create long-term environmental, social, and economic resilience by supporting employment pathways, food sovereignty, and culturally grounded housing solutions for Northland whānau.
