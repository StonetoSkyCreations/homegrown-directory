Rebel Gardens is the passion project of Craig "Griff" Griffiths, who cultivates a "lovely bit of paradise" between Martinborough and Greytown. Griff specialises in small batches of diverse vegetables, focusing on flavour over appearance. His main summer crop is gourmet Jersey Benne potatoes, dug, packed in biodegradable bags and sold within 24 hours. When the potatoes finish, carrots and beetroot take their place, and he grows specialty courgettes such as the nutty Constanta Romanesco variety. He continually experiments with new crops to meet customer requests.

Microgreens are a year-round staple, grown on a seven-day cycle and popular with chefs and home cooks. Rebel Gardens sells produce at Martinborough's Memorial Square every Saturday and at the TK and Greytown markets from October to April. Griff also offers online delivery within the South Wairarapa via his website. To minimise waste, he composts heavily and tends the soil by hand. Customers can contact Griff via email or mobile, or follow @rebel_gardens on Instagram for updates on what's growing.
