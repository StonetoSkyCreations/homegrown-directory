Little Farms is a collective of small organic and regenerative growers across the Wairarapa, bringing fresh, local, transparently grown produce straight to homes throughout the Wairarapa, Hutt Valley, and Wellington. Their own market garden in Pirinoa follows strict regenerative organic principles: no synthetic sprays, no tilling, and a deep commitment to building healthy soil.

They partner with ten local farms—most BioGro-certified or Hua Parakore certified—to fill their weekly Farm Boxes with a seasonal mix of vegetables, herbs, and specialty items. Each week’s harvest is planned around real-time availability, ensuring the produce is truly local, freshly picked, and aligned with the seasons.

## How Little Farms Works

You can choose from several ordering options:

1. **Seasonal Farm Boxes**  
   The widest variety of vegetables, curated weekly from their partner farms. Options range from small to large whānau-sized boxes.

2. **Choose-Your-Own Box**  
   Pick every item yourself from what is available that week.

3. **Seconds Boxes (“Ugly Boxes”)**  
   Great value boxes filled with cosmetically imperfect but perfectly edible produce.

Extras such as bread, eggs, meat, honey, and pantry items can be added to any order. Meat is delivered frozen with strict handling guidelines and is available only to Wairarapa, Hutt Valley, and Wellington addresses.

## Delivery & Pick-Up

- Home delivery across Wairarapa, Hutt Valley, and Wellington.  
- Masterton pick-up available Wednesdays (1–5pm) at Bin Inn Masterton.  
- Orders close each Sunday at midnight.  

Subscribers receive their boxes automatically each week or fortnight and help farms plan ahead with confidence.

## Workshops & Education

Little Farms also runs hands-on workshops—no-dig gardening, regenerative growing, and starter courses—helping people learn how to grow nutrient-dense food at home. E-guides and digital resources are also available.

## Sustainability in Practice

- Regenerative, no-dig farming on their own land.  
- Most partner farms are certified organic; the smallest farms follow the same principles without certification.  
- Home-compostable packaging wherever possible.  
- Boxes and packaging can be returned for reuse or composting.  
- Transparency is central to their ethos—visits are welcome, and their Instagram accounts show daily life on the farm.  

Little Farms exists to build a resilient local food system by supporting small growers, caring for soil, and delivering honest, seasonal produce to the community.
