description: A Chatham Islands seafood producer supplying wild-caught, pot-caught ocean harvest - especially blue cod - handled for quality from a remote, cold-water fishery.
long_description: >
  Chatham Island Food Co sources wild seafood from the waters surrounding Rekohu/Wharekauri (the Chatham Islands), leaning on selective methods and careful handling to protect both quality and ecosystem integrity. Their story emphasises remoteness as an advantage: cold, clean currents; tight harvest windows; and a supply chain built to preserve "just-caught" character through rapid processing and frozen-at-source logistics. This is classic Homegrown alignment - real food from a known place, gathered under New Zealand's fisheries rules, then sold direct so provenance stays intact.
