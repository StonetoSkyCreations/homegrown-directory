description: "Bostock New Zealand is a pioneering Hawke\u2019s Bay grower and New Zealand\u2019s largest organic apple producer, growing premium organic fruit and vegetables in partnership with nature."
long_description: "Bostock New Zealand is one of Aotearoa\u2019s most established organic horticulture producers, based in Hawke\u2019s Bay and wholly owned by grower John Bostock. A pioneer of commercial-scale organic apple production, the farm began converting from conventional growing in the mid-1990s, driven by concerns for soil health, human wellbeing, and long-term ecological integrity. Today, Bostock New Zealand grows and exports certified organic apples, onions, squash, pumpkins, and grain, while also marketing conventional apples on behalf of independent orchardists.\n\nThe operation is grounded in a philosophy of working with natural systems rather than against them, protecting soils, waterways, and the region\u2019s artesian aquifer for future generations. Bostock New Zealand is also recognised for leadership in sustainable packaging, including home-compostable fruit stickers, compostable onion netting, and recyclable cardboard trays. Beyond production, the business is deeply\
  \ embedded in the Hawke\u2019s Bay community, supporting local employment pathways, iwi partnerships, healthy eating initiatives, and community food resilience.\n"
