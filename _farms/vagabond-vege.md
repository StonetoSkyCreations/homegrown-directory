Vagabond Vege is a collaborative, human-scale market garden based on the old river terraces of the Waiohine River in Greytown. The farmers use agroecological principles to grow high-quality, nutrient-dense food. They are committed to no-till horticulture, removing chemical inputs and cultivating dense, diverse plantings to enhance soil life, improve carbon sequestration and build resilience. Vagabond Vege is working through the three-year Hua Parakore certification, a kaupapa Maori framework that ensures foods are free from GMOs, pesticides and synthetic fertilisers.

Their produce is available through Little Farms' seasonal boxes and also via a weekly wholesale fresh list for local restaurants and caterers. On the farm, they prioritise diversity—growing multiple species per bed—and collaborate with other growers to overcome barriers such as land access, finance and expertise. Customers can reach out via email or phone, and the farm occasionally hosts open days to share knowledge about regenerative growing. Vagabond Vege proves that small-scale, community-oriented farms can feed people while regenerating the land.
