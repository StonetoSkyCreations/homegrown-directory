Bayleaf Organics is a family-owned organic apple orchard based in Haumoana,
Hawke's Bay, growing premium organic apples across several family-run orchards
in the region. Founded in 2005 by Craig and Wendy Dowling, the farm emerged from
a multi-generational orchard background and a decision to move away from
chemical-intensive growing toward organic systems that protect people, land,
and waterways. Bayleaf Organics grows apples in harmony with Hawke's Bay's
fertile soils and artesian water, focusing on tree-ripened fruit, natural
seasonal cycles, and long-term orchard health rather than post-harvest shelf
life manipulation. The orchard does not use synthetic sprays, chemical
fertilisers, SmartFresh, or artificial coatings, relying instead on organic
soil-building practices, biological pest control, and careful harvest timing.
Bayleaf Organics is BioGro certified and LEAF Marque certified, and is known for
producing clean, honest organic apples supplied locally through farmers'
markets and regional retailers, as well as to export markets.
