long_description: |
  Pākaraka Permaculture is a 215‑acre agro‑ecological farm in the Kauaeranga Valley near Thames. The property features chestnut, olive and pecan orchards, vegetable gardens, animals and food forests. It has been certified organic with Organic Farms New Zealand since 1991 and operates off‑grid with solar and micro‑hydro power. The market garden produces over 10,000 kg of vegetables on just a quarter acre using no‑dig regenerative techniques. An organic olive grove of 100 trees yields a high‑quality extra‑virgin olive oil. The farm sells seasonal produce, olive oil and chestnuts, and hosts workshops and online courses teaching permaculture design and regenerative farming. Visitors are welcome by appointment and can arrange tours or volunteer stays; contact is via email.
