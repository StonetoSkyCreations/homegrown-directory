The property features chestnut, olive and pecan orchards, vegetable gardens, animals and food forests. It has been certified organic with Organic Farms New Zealand since 1991 and operates off\u2011grid with solar and micro\u2011hydro power. The market garden produces over 10,000 kg of vegetables on just a quarter acre using no\u2011dig regenerative techniques. An organic olive grove of 100 trees yields a high\u2011quality extra\u2011virgin olive oil. The farm sells seasonal produce, olive oil and chestnuts, and hosts workshops and online courses teaching permaculture design and regenerative farming. Visitors are welcome by appointment and can arrange tours or volunteer stays; contact is via email.\n"
