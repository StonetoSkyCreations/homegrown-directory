T Gasper is a small spray-free farm on the outskirts of Masterton. While the farm keeps a low public profile, it contributes fresh, spray-free vegetables to the Little Farms seasonal boxes. Like all farms in the Little Farms collective, T Gasper follows organic principles and holds itself to high standards of soil health and environmental stewardship. Their diverse crops add variety and resilience to the collective's weekly harvest.
