long_description: |
  Mac Snacks is a heritage macadamia orchard based in Tikorangi, near Waitara in
  Taranaki, and is widely regarded as a pioneer of New Zealand’s macadamia
  industry. All products are grown and produced on the family’s BioGro-certified
  organic orchard, Greenacres, which has been in the family for more than 100
  years.

  The orchard’s macadamia story began in 1975 when Felix Jury became one of New
  Zealand’s first experimental macadamia growers, importing a range of varieties
  from around the world. The first 400 trees were planted in 1978, with a further
  800 added sixteen years later, establishing what is now the country’s oldest
  macadamia orchard.

  Greenacres was converted to organic production in stages before achieving full
  BioGro certification in 1995. Since then, the farm has received multiple
  environmental awards, including a Ballance Farm Environment Award, recognising
  its long-standing commitment to ecological stewardship.

  The orchard is managed using low-intervention, nature-aligned practices. Sheep
  graze beneath the macadamia trees to control grass growth and make nut
  harvesting easier, while native shelter plantings protect both macadamia and
  avocado trees, enhance biodiversity, and provide additional benefits such as
  honey production and livestock fodder.

  The cool Taranaki nights are a defining feature of the orchard’s terroir and
  are credited with giving Mac Snacks’ macadamias their distinctively rich,
  creamy flavour. Nuts are harvested by hand between September and December,
  then de-husked, dried, cracked, and processed on-farm using custom-built
  machinery, maintaining full traceability from tree to finished product.

  Mac Snacks produces a range of premium organic macadamia products, including
  Natural & Crispy macadamias, lightly salted Golden Roasted nuts, Lite Roasted
  options, organic macadamia nut spreads, and organic chocolate macadamia bars.
  In addition to macadamias, the farm also grows organic avocados and a small
  range of seasonal fruit and vegetables.

  Products are sold directly through the Mac Snacks online store, at the
  Taranaki Farmers Market each Sunday, and via selected organic retailers,
  including Down to Earth Organics in New Plymouth. Visitors are welcome to visit
  the Tikorangi orchard by arrangement, offering a rare opportunity to see New
  Zealand’s macadamia heritage in action.
