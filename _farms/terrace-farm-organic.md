long_description: "Terrace Farm Organic is a pioneering mixed farm near Methven on the Mid Canterbury plains. Certified organic with BioGro since 1985, the family operation combines livestock and cropping in a traditional mixed system, raising certified organic beef and lamb alongside organic arable rotations. The high-country setting near the Rakaia River supports resilient pastures and diverse crops, and the team have spent decades refining low-input, soil-friendly practices that meet strict organic standards. Meat is certified to the BioGro trademark, and the farm remains a staple in New Zealand\u2019s organic producer directories.\n"
