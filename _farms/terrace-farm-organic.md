long_description: |
  Terrace Farm Organic is a pioneering family-run mixed farm located near Methven on the Mid Canterbury Plains. Certified organic with BioGro since 1985, the farm has spent decades refining a traditional mixed cropping and livestock system that prioritises soil health, biological balance, and long-term resilience. Set in the high-country landscape near the Rakaia River, Terrace Farm benefits from resilient pastures and a climate well suited to both arable crops and livestock.

  The farm raises certified organic beef and lamb alongside organic grain rotations, integrating animals directly into the fertility cycle. Livestock provide natural manure for cropping land, while green manure crops such as buckwheat are used to build soil structure and nutrient availability without synthetic fertilisers. This closed-loop system reflects a deeply regenerative approach grounded in long-term stewardship rather than short-term yield.

  Terrace Farm is especially well known for its organic grains and flours, which are milled to order to preserve freshness, flavour, and nutritional value. Using a combination of traditional stone milling and specialist Zentrofan mills, the farm produces wholemeal and wholegrain flours that retain the natural oils and vitality often lost in large-scale commercial processing. Terrace Farm remains a respected cornerstone of New Zealand's organic food landscape and producer directories.
