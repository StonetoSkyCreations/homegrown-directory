long_description: |
  The Wilderland Trust has been growing organic food in the Coromandel since 1964. Its 64‑hectare property is managed using permaculture principles, regenerative agriculture and off‑grid living systems. Residents and volunteers cultivate a diverse mix of vegetables, herbs, fruit trees and honey, learning hands‑on skills in organic farming, preserving and land stewardship. The farm sells seasonal produce, honey, herbal teas and handmade preserves through its small onsite shop and at local markets, and offers volunteer placements and workshops for those interested in sustainable living. Wilderland’s mission is to inspire people to engage in whole‑systems education and cultivate a healthier relationship with the land.
