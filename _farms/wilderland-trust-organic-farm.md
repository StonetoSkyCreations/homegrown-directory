  Founded in 1964 on the Coromandel Peninsula, Wilderland Trust is an organic farm and sustainable living center rooted in self-reliance and whole education. Established by Dan and Edith Hansen as an anarchist, vegetarian community, it operates as a living classroom where everyone is both student and teacher, learning by doing through gardening, building, beekeeping, preserving, and "nimble living" - creating abundance with minimal expenditure. The community is drug- and alcohol-free to keep the space grounded and supportive for learning and living well together.

  The trust stewards 64 hectares, with around 80% set aside for regenerating native bush. Kaitiakitanga guides their approach: minimize ecological footprint, keep biological systems diverse and productive, and build closed-loop relationships with the land, from using black wattle for building to harvesting estuary reeds for garden mulch.

  Wilderland blends organic and regenerative methods, including syntropic agroforestry, hugelkultur beds, no-till soil care, and cover crops to rebuild soil life. The gardens produce a diverse spread of fruit, vegetables, herbs, and honey without synthetic inputs, and the property models off-grid permaculture systems such as solar power, greywater bio-filtration, and rainwater storage. Land-grown abundance is crafted into teas, herbs, honey, and skincare available through their roadside shop and local markets.
