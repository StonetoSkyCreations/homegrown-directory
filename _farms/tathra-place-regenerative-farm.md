long_description: |
  Tathra Place Regenerative Farm is a 100-acre working farm located in the Wombeyan Caves region of New South Wales. Established in 2015 by Luke and Pia Winder, the farm was developed from degraded pasture with the intention of restoring soil health, biodiversity, and ecological function while producing nutrient-dense food.

  The farm operates without synthetic chemicals, pesticides, fertilisers, hormones, or routine antibiotics. Livestock are managed through a multi-species rotational grazing system designed to mimic natural ecosystems. Cattle and sheep are followed by poultry, ducks, quail, and pigs, which together contribute to soil fertility, pest control, and pasture regeneration.

  Animals are raised entirely outdoors and protected by Maremma guardian dogs, allowing free-range systems to function without chemical interventions. Carbon-rich bedding from poultry systems is composted and returned to the land to build soil organic matter. The farm focuses on closed-loop nutrient cycling and long-term land stewardship.

  Tathra Place is vertically integrated, with produce processed and distributed directly through associated butcher shops and direct sales channels, maintaining full traceability from farm to consumer. The farm also hosts regular educational tours to share regenerative farming practices with the wider community.
