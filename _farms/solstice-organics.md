long_description: 'Solstice Organics is a small market garden based in Whenuapai, Auckland, operating according to regenerative organic principles. The farm focuses on growing high-quality, nutrient-dense food while actively improving soil health, ecosystem resilience, and human wellbeing. Their approach is inspired by the regenerative power of nature and the interdependence between soil, people, and the wider environment.


  Solstice Organics supplies selected retailers, restaurants, and caterers across Auckland, while also offering direct sales through veggie boxes, CSA-style subscriptions, and farm pickups by arrangement. Orders placed before 7am on Thursdays are delivered fresh on Fridays within designated Auckland areas. The farm also trades weekly at the Titirangi Village Market on Sundays.
