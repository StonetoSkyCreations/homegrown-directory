Beach Road Milk Co is a family-owned raw milk farm based in Omata, Taranaki,
producing raw A2 protein milk for the local community via a self-serve roadside
milk kiosk. Run by third-generation farmers Ryan Gargan and Megan Turner, the
farm focuses on soil health, animal wellbeing, and low-intervention farming
systems. Milk is sold raw, unpasteurised, and non-homogenised, travelling
directly from cow to consumer with no processing or food miles. The herd is
DNA-tested for A2 protein, and cows are pasture-fed year-round on diverse mixed
species swards including legumes, rye, plantain, and chicory. The farm follows
bio-organic principles, using organic fertilisers and closed-loop effluent
systems with no chemical sprays or synthetic fertilisers. The honesty-based
kiosk is also a community hub, offering locally produced eggs, vegetables,
bread, and honey from nearby growers.
