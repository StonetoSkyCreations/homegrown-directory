Te Manaia Organics was founded in 1990 on the rich alluvial soils near Masterton. Owner Jeremy Howden established the farm with a determination to avoid chemical methods, and the property has been officially certified organic since 1995. Jeremy's early crops included then-rare vegetables such as radicchio, fennel and celeriac alongside staples like sprouting broccoli, spinach and onions. After spending time overseas, Jeremy relaunched the business with his son Alex and fiancee Evie, injecting fresh energy and vision into the farm.

Today, Te Manaia supplies Little Farms' boxes as well as farmers markets in Wellington and Masterton. The Howden family continue to champion organic farming, growing a wide variety of vegetables without synthetic chemicals and experimenting with unusual crops to inspire adventurous eaters. Their story is one of family legacy, a deep love of good food and an unwavering commitment to organic principles.
