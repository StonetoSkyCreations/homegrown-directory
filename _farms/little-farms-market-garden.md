The Little Farms Market Garden is the beating heart of the Little Farms collective. Located in Pirinoa, South Wairarapa, this small market garden grows its crops regeneratively, using no synthetic fertilisers, herbicides or insecticides. Instead, farmers build fertile soil by layering natural organic matter on top of the existing ground and maintain the beds using no-dig methods. These practices protect soil biology and help sequester carbon while yielding nutrient-dense produce.

At this tiny yet productive plot, a diverse range of seasonal vegetables and herbs are grown for inclusion in Little Farms' subscription boxes. Visitors can follow daily farm life through the farm's Instagram account (@growing._goodness) and sometimes arrange on-farm tours. The market garden also serves as a demonstration site for regenerative agriculture, inspiring others to grow food in harmony with the land. By nurturing soil, preserving biodiversity and sharing knowledge openly, the Little Farms Market Garden embodies the farm's motto: fresh food grown with respect for the earth.
