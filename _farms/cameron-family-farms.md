Cameron Family Farms (registered as T Base 2 Limited) is a pioneering organic farm near Featherston. Founded by filmmaker James Cameron and author Suzy Cameron, the operation is guided by values of ethical, organic and plant-based farming. The farm managers produce nutrient-rich compost, use only organic fertilisers and constantly experiment with sustainable practices aimed at improving soil health. They advocate for plant-based diets and share knowledge with local farmers through field days and permaculture courses.

Beyond vegetables, Cameron Family Farms has diversified into walnuts, hemp and flaxseed; they press olive, flaxseed and hemp oils and have planted a walnut grove that is in organic conversion. The farm also crafts natural cosmetics—lip balms, bath salts and soaps—made from their own honey, beeswax and herbs. Customers can buy fresh produce and pantry items at their flagship store and cafe, Food Forest Organics in Greytown, or visit the depot at 10 Daniell Street in Featherston. The farm runs 24-hour pick-up hours at the depot and can be contacted via their website, email or phone.
