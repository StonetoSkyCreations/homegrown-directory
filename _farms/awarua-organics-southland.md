  A network of certified organic dairy farms in Southland supplying AwaRua Organics with grass-fed milk for organic milk powders.
long_description: |
  AwaRua Organics sources milk from a dedicated group of certified organic dairy farms in the Awarua region of Southland. These farms completed a multi-year transition to organic production and now operate under strict organic certification standards, with pasture-based systems and year-round outdoor grazing.

  The farms focus on soil health, animal welfare, and water stewardship, avoiding synthetic pesticides, fertilisers, antibiotics, additives, and preservatives. Pasture diversity and organic forage crops support resilient grass-fed systems, and milk is collected and processed close to the farms to preserve freshness and traceability.

  While the AwaRua Organics brand is administered from Auckland, on-farm production and milk collection are rooted in Southland’s temperate climate and long-standing dairy farming communities.
