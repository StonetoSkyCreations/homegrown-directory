  Kaitake Farm is a small, bio-intensive market garden located in Ōākura,
  Taranaki, nestled at the foothills of the Kaitake Ranges in a sheltered
  micro-climate. Established from a desire for local food resilience and
  environmentally responsible growing, the farm focuses on producing fresh,
  seasonal vegetables for its surrounding community using no-dig, chemical-free
  methods.

  The 1/2-acre site was previously a certified organic kiwifruit orchard and is
  now being given a new stage of life as a diverse, productive food garden.
  Kaitake Farm grows all of its produce on site and follows organic principles
  throughout, despite not holding formal certification due to cost and
  administration barriers. No pesticides, herbicides, synthetic fertilisers, or
  GMOs are used at any stage of production.

  Soil health sits at the centre of the farm’s approach. Using bio-intensive and
  no-dig methods, the team builds fertility through mulching, living ground
  covers, home-made compost (Kaicycle compost), and farm-made inputs such as
  seaweed tea. Living mulches and diverse plantings support beneficial insects
  and biodiversity, while collected rainwater is used to irrigate the greenhouse,
  reducing reliance on external resources.

  Kaitake Farm was founded with a strong community focus — to shorten food
  supply chains, reduce food miles, and help people reconnect with where their
  food comes from. This ethos is reflected in their innovative, trust-based sales
  model. Produce is available via a self-serve honesty box system, including the
  use of the My Honesty Box app, allowing customers to buy directly from the
  farm’s roadside stall.

  The farm grows a wide range of seasonal vegetables and salad greens, adapting
  plantings to the natural rhythms of the Taranaki climate. Winter harvests have
  included beetroot, turnips, silverbeet, kale, spinach, and carrots, while
  summer crops feature tomatoes, capsicums, cucumbers, and zucchini. Fresh salad
  greens are a staple offering throughout the year.

  Collaboration is a key part of Kaitake Farm’s model. Their produce is available
  through trusted local partners including Beach Road Milk Co, Down to Earth
  Organics, Ōākura Four Square, and Moturoa Four Square, as well as being supplied
  to local cafés and eateries. Together, these relationships form a resilient
  local food network rooted in transparency, trust, and shared values.
