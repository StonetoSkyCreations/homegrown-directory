long_description: >
  The Farm Byron Bay is a working regenerative farm built around the principles of growing, feeding, and educating. The site supports a network of micro-businesses, farmers, and food producers who share a commitment to traditional, sustainable farming methods that are spray-free and chemical-free.

  The farm raises heritage-breed pigs, Scottish Highland cattle, and free-roaming chickens, alongside fields of vegetables, greens, and flowers. Produce and animal products are used directly within the on-site restaurant, cafe, and produce store, creating a closed-loop system between land and plate.

  In addition to food production, The Farm functions as a community and learning space. Visitors are encouraged to explore the property, engage with farmers, observe a working farm in progress, and participate in guided tours, workshops, and children's activities. The project operates with a stated focus on environmental, social, and economic sustainability, positioning the farm as a shared resource for the wider community.
