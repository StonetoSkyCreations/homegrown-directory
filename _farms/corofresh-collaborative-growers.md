long_description: |
  CoroFresh is a collaboration of small growers based around Coroglen who are passionate about growing nutrient‑dense food for their community. The growers follow regenerative and sustainable practices, farming with hand tools and without synthetic sprays or tractors to reduce fossil‑fuel use. Their produce includes seasonal vegetables, salad greens, microgreens, herbs, fruits and honey sourced from members like Claire’s Garden, Goodness Growers and Jacob’s Well Honey. Each supplier uses permaculture and organic methods such as no‑dig beds, compost teas and biodiversity plantings. Customers can purchase produce boxes and honey via the online platform and collect from central drop‑off points or arrange local delivery. Contact is through the website and social media.
