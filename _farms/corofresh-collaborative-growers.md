long_description: "CoroFresh is a collaboration of small growers based around Coroglen who are passionate about growing nutrient\u2011dense food for their community. The growers follow regenerative and sustainable practices, farming with hand tools and without synthetic sprays or tractors to reduce fossil\u2011fuel use. Their produce includes seasonal vegetables, salad greens, microgreens, herbs, fruits and honey sourced from members like Claire\u2019s Garden, Goodness Growers and Jacob\u2019s Well Honey. Each supplier uses permaculture and organic methods such as no\u2011dig beds, compost teas and biodiversity plantings. Customers can purchase produce boxes and honey via the online platform and collect from central drop\u2011off points or arrange local delivery. Contact is through the website and social media.\n"
