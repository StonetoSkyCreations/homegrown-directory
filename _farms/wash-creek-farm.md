  Wash Creek Farm (WashCreek Organic Meats) is a BioGro Certified Organic livestock operation in the Hurunui district of North Canterbury. Founded in 2015 by experienced organic farmers, the business raises premium organic lamb and beef with a strong focus on humane handling and ecological land care. Livestock graze rotationally across the coastal hills at Mt Cass Station on diverse pasture mixes of chicory, clover, lucerne and plantain to build soil health and animal resilience. Wash Creek specialises in Wiltshire sheep and composite beef cattle, delivering clean, chemical-free protein through nationwide meat boxes as well as retail and wholesale supply.
