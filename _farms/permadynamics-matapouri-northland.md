long_description: |
  PermaDynamics is a multigenerational family-run research farm and education
  centre based in Matapouri, Northland. Known as leading practitioners of
  syntropic agroforestry in Aotearoa, they combine forest succession dynamics
  with permaculture, biodynamics, and regenerative farming to rapidly rebuild
  soil, increase biodiversity, and produce abundant, high-density food systems.

  Since arriving in Aotearoa in 2003, the family has transformed steep, degraded,
  compacted clay hillsides (previously grazed and kikuyu-dominated) into a
  thriving, human-inclusive sanctuary rich in birdlife and soil biology. Their
  main syntropic food forest spans around two acres and contains 350+ plant
  species, integrating fruit, nut, biomass, and native trees, with additional
  riparian plantings and temperate syntropic orchard systems across the
  property. Alongside the forest systems, PermaDynamics runs a no-till, organic
  market garden interwoven with syntropic tree rows, plus compost systems,
  mushroom production stations, a tree nursery, and on-farm infrastructure that
  supports education and practical land-based skills.

  PermaDynamics is also an education hub, having taught 2,000+ students on-farm
  and online. They share applied, experience-led learning through workshops,
  courses, and a community membership that supports growers at every stage of
  their regenerative journey. For practitioners designing food forests, they
  created SAPP (Syntropic Agroforestry & Permaculture Planner), an interactive
  plant database and planning tool that helps match species to site conditions
  and system roles.

  Produce and on-farm goods vary seasonally and may include tropical and
  subtropical crops (for example, bananas, tamarillos, citrus), specialty plants
  and nursery stock (including cuttings), ferments and preserved foods, and
  diverse market garden harvests. Their sales and outreach extend beyond the
  farm via local markets, online learning, and consultancy, with a strong
  emphasis on community resilience, knowledge sharing, and landscape
  regeneration.
