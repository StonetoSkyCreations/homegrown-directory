long_description: |
  The Kōanga Institute is a renowned charitable trust and education centre located near
  Wairoa in northern Hawke’s Bay. Widely regarded as guardians of Aotearoa’s food
  heritage, Kōanga holds New Zealand’s largest national collection of organic heritage
  seeds and food plants — with 800+ heritage vegetable cultivars and 400+ fruit and
  berry varieties — alongside the stories, whakapapa, and community relationships that
  have carried these taonga forward.

  Most of Kōanga’s collection is made up of New Zealand heritage lines that have been
  grown here for multiple generations, selected for flavour, nutrition, resilience, and
  suitability to local soils and climate. Their approach is “beyond organic”: a biological,
  soil-first growing system designed to build mineral-rich, microbially active soils and
  support truly nutrient-dense plants.

  Kōanga primarily grows for seed production, plant collection stewardship, and research
  rather than fresh-produce sales. Their gardens and production systems include rare and
  endangered heritage vegetables, grains, fruit trees, berries, perennials, and traditional
  greens. They also operate as a major regenerative education hub, offering workshops,
  guided tours (by booking), online learning, and publications on seed saving, permaculture,
  forest gardening, regenerative living, and related practical skills.

  Their wider mission is community resilience and self-reliance. Through initiatives such
  as the Kōanga Kai kaupapa, they support whānau and communities to establish home and
  communal gardens, helping strengthen local food security while keeping heritage genetics
  alive in living systems.
