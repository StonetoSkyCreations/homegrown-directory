long_description: |
  Kelmarna Community Farm is a certified organic urban farm located in Ponsonby, Auckland, dedicated to regenerative food production, community wellbeing, and education. Operating as a community-owned trust, Kelmarna grows a wide range of seasonal vegetables, fruit, eggs, and pasture-raised meat using organic and permaculture-based systems that prioritise soil health, biodiversity, and closed-loop nutrient cycling.

  The farm supplies produce directly to the public through its on-site farm shop and Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme, as well as to local restaurants and food businesses, including Forest, Kingi, Mr Morris, and Pici. Integrated livestock, composting through their Soil Factory social enterprise, and diverse growing systems - including market gardens, food forest, and silvopasture - underpin Kelmarna's regenerative approach. Beyond food, the farm is a vital community hub, offering therapeutic gardening programmes, workshops, volunteer training, and seasonal events that reconnect people with land, food, and each other.
