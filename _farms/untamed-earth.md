Untamed Earth is an Otautahi-based organic farm rooted in a simple principle: when we care for the soil, the soil cares for us. Founded by Penny, Ollie, and Isaac--three growers who spent years working side by side on organic farms across Canterbury--the farm is the result of long conversations in the field about what matters, why it matters, and how food should be grown.

Today, Untamed Earth stewards 60 acres of organic market gardens across Christchurch, producing more than forty different kinds of vegetables, herbs, and seasonal crops. Their approach is hands-on and soil-first. Rather than forcing the land into uniformity or chasing high-input yields, they work with natural systems: diverse plantings, organic matter cycling, regenerative techniques, and patient observation. The farm is certified organic through AsureQuality (#1238), ensuring every crop is grown without synthetic chemicals, fertilisers, or pesticides.

The team grows everything from familiar staples--carrots, broccoli, lettuce--to more unique varieties you will not find in a supermarket, reflecting both the creativity of small-scale farming and the diversity of seasonal abundance. Every crop is grown with the guiding belief that nature already knows what it is doing; the farmer's role is to support, not interfere.

Community connection is woven through the heart of Untamed Earth. You will find them every week at the Ohoka, Lyttelton, and South Christchurch farmers' markets, where their stall has become a reliable source of fresh produce and friendly conversation. They also run their own Farm Shop in Beckenham at 140 Colombo Street, offering seasonal vegetables, herbs, fruit, freshly baked bread, and other local goods. For those who cannot make it in person, home-delivered veggie boxes make it easy to access organic produce directly from the farm.

Untamed Earth also supplies local wholefood stores and some of Christchurch's favourite cafes and restaurants -- building relationships that keep the local food economy strong and transparent. These partnerships, along with their customer relationships at the markets and farm shop, are part of what keeps the farm accountable, grounded, and connected.

At its core, Untamed Earth is shaped by a belief in working with the land rather than against it. Organic farming is not the easiest path -- it demands skill, patience, and constant adaptation. But for the team, the rewards are clear: healthy soil, vibrant crops, and a community nourished by food grown with integrity.
