long_description: 'Te Matuku Oysters grows Pacific oysters in Te Matuku Bay on Waiheke
  Island - one of those places where the water, tide, and season do most of the work.
  As a producer, the focus is on freshness and a clean growing environment, supplying
  oysters into local channels rather than operating as a public-facing restaurant.
  For Homegrown, this is a simple relationship: place-based aquaculture, a short path
  from bay to plate, and a product that tastes like the inlet it came from.
