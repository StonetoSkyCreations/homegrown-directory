Wharerata Farm sits in the heart of South Wairarapa's Pirinoa district, framed by the Haurangi Ranges and near Palliser Bay. The Atkinson family has farmed here for almost a century and achieved certified organic status in 1990. Fourth-generation farmer Sophie Atkinson and her partner Tim manage a diverse enterprise spanning deer, beef cattle, sheep and around 100 organic dairy grazers. The 200-hectare effective area benefits from fertile soils and a temperate microclimate.

Sustainability is woven into every aspect of Wharerata. Sophie's parents retired unprofitable land to plant native trees and create wildlife habitat, a practice she continues. The farm plants up to 14 species in their pastures to give stock a "fruit salad" of nutrition and maintains 10 hectares of covenanted native bush. Their environmental efforts earned Wharerata the NZDFA Next Generation Award in 2021. Beyond livestock, Tim manages 120 beehives and the couple export honey through their new company Haurangi Heartland Ltd. Wharerata supplies organic venison through First Light Farms and occasionally offers lamb pre-orders via Little Farms. Visiting the farm reveals a rare blend of heritage, innovation and ecological care.
