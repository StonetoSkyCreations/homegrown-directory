description: Certified organic macadamia orchard near Cathedral Cove producing nuts and cold‑pressed macadamia oil with an onsite caravan shop for tastings and sales.
long_description: |
  Jill and Doug Johnston’s macadamia orchard sprawls over 17.5 acres of hills behind Cathedral Cove and is home to around 1,000 forty‑year‑old macadamia trees. The farm is fully certified organic, far exceeding basic spray‑free practices. Most of the nuts are sold by mail order, but there is a caravan shop on site where visitors can purchase macadamia nuts, cold‑pressed oil and other macadamia products and sample the sweet, aromatic kernels. The orchard is open to the public from September through March on Fridays to Mondays, with visits by appointment at other times. Friendly goats roam the property and the orchard’s award‑winning oil has been recognised as one of the finest locally produced oils.
