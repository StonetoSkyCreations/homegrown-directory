long_description: |
  BioFarm is a pioneering, family-owned organic farm located on the banks of the
  Manawat\u016B River in Palmerston North. Certified organic since 1986, it is one of
  the longest continuously operating organic farms in Aotearoa and remains owned
  and run by its original custodians, Cathy and Jamie Tait-Jamieson.

  The land has been in the family for more than 80 years, with BioFarm emerging
  from a conscious decision to move away from industrial agriculture and toward
  farming systems that prioritise ecological health, animal welfare, and human
  wellbeing. Their approach is grounded in biodynamic and organic principles,
  working with natural cycles rather than attempting to control them.

  BioFarm is uniquely single-origin: the milk is produced on-farm and
  transformed into yoghurt on the same land. Jamie personally crafts every
  batch, ensuring freshness, traceability, and integrity from pasture to spoon.
  Their yoghurts contain nothing but organic milk, live probiotic cultures, and
  organic flavours, with no preservatives, thickeners, stabilisers, milk solids,
  or artificial additives.

  Animal welfare is central to BioFarm\u2019s philosophy. The farm practices
  non-separation of cows and calves, supports multispecies grazing systems, and
  maintains a diverse landscape that includes dairy, beef, sheep, goats, trees,
  and wildlife habitat, deliberately moving away from monoculture farming.

  Regeneration has been embedded in BioFarm\u2019s practices for decades. From no-till
  systems and multispecies pastures to extensive tree planting for flood
  protection, shelter, and carbon sequestration, the farm functions as a living
  ecosystem rather than a production unit.

  BioFarm\u2019s work reflects a belief that health begins with soil, and that
  farming, when done with care and humility, can nourish land, animals, and
  communities for generations to come.
