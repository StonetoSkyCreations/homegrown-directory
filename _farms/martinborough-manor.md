Martinborough Manor is a spray-free boutique farm nestled just minutes from the town square. Visitors can enjoy guided tours of the working farm, where they bottle-feed lambs or goats in spring, wander through stunning gardens and browse the farm store for preserves, fresh fruit, flowers, eggs and vegetables. Tours last about 1.5 hours and are available on Saturdays and Sundays at 10:30 am and 2:30 pm.

The farm produces a wide array of seasonal treats: juicy apricots, mandarins and grapefruit; gorgeous bouquets of spray-free flowers; farm-fresh eggs; and homemade preserves. The family behind Martinborough Manor follows organic principles but keeps operations small enough to maintain close control over every crop. Their commitment to spray-free growing means visitors can pick and taste produce straight from the orchard. For those wishing to bring home a taste of the farm, the on-site shop offers jams, chutneys and honey, along with seasonal flowers. To book a tour or enquire about the farm, visitors can call or visit their website.
