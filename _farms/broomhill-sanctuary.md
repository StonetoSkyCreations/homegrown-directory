long_description: |
  BROOMHILL Sanctuary is a regenerative land-based project rooted in stewardship, reciprocity, and seasonal living. Located in the alpine landscape of Glenorchy, Otago, the sanctuary focuses on growing nourishing food while cultivating ecological awareness, practical skills, and meaningful relationships with land and community.

  Food is grown using organic and regenerative principles, adapted to a challenging alpine climate. Rather than operating as a commercial food business, BROOMHILL functions through a CSA-inspired stewardship model, where participants contribute time, presence, and financial support to help meet the real costs of growing, learning, and caring for the whenua.

  The sanctuary offers opportunities for community members, stewards, and volunteers to engage in hands-on gardening, seasonal practices, and land-based learning. BROOMHILL exists as a living practice, nurturing resilience in people and ecosystems, and demonstrating pathways toward local food sovereignty and regenerative futures.
