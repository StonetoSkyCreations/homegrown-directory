long_description: |
  Shiny Shovel is a privately run organic farm located near the Hurunui River in North Canterbury. The farm is operated by Chas and has supplied organic garlic to Christchurch retailer Piko Wholefoods for many years.

  The farm operates using genuine organic practices, avoiding synthetic fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides. Garlic is grown using traditional methods that work with natural systems rather than against them. Crops are planted in raised mounds to improve warmth, drainage, and bulb development, particularly during the colder winter months.

  Weed management is carried out using a low-impact manual technique where weeds are loosened around garlic plants and left in place to decompose. This approach suppresses further weed growth while returning organic matter and nutrients directly back into the soil.

  The farm is noted by its retail partner for being meticulously maintained and well organised, reflecting a high level of care and attention in day-to-day farming practices. Shiny Shovel does not operate a farm gate or public-facing business and instead supplies exclusively through trusted local channels.
