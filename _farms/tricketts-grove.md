description: Canterbury-grown walnuts from a grower co-operative focused on freshness, low-intervention orcharding, and cracking nuts “just in time” for peak flavour and nutrition.
long_description: >
  Trickett’s Grove is a co-operative of around 40–45 New Zealand walnut growers, mostly based in Canterbury, formed to locally process and pack their own harvest for maximum freshness and traceability. Their approach is simple: prune, feed, water, and let the trees do the rest—limiting sprays and favouring as little intervention as possible, with some member orchards BioGro certified organic.

  Walnuts are harvested in autumn, then washed, sorted, dried, and quality-tested before being processed at the West Melton facilities. Cracking “just in time” helps protect flavour and nutrients compared with long-stored imported kernels. The operation aims for a zero-waste loop, with shells composted into garden mix and by-products redirected into useful secondary streams.
