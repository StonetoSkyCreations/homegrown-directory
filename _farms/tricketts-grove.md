description: "Canterbury-grown walnuts from a grower co-operative focused on freshness, low-intervention orcharding, and cracking nuts \u201Cjust in time\u201D for peak flavour and nutrition."
long_description: "Trickett\u2019s Grove is a co-operative of around 40\u201345 New Zealand walnut growers, mostly based in Canterbury, formed to locally process and pack their own harvest for maximum freshness and traceability. Their approach is simple: prune, feed, water, and let the trees do the rest\u2014limiting sprays and favouring as little intervention as possible, with some member orchards BioGro certified organic.\nWalnuts are harvested in autumn, then washed, sorted, dried, and quality-tested before being processed at the West Melton facilities. Cracking \u201Cjust in time\u201D helps protect flavour and nutrients compared with long-stored imported kernels. The operation aims for a zero-waste loop, with shells composted into garden mix and by-products redirected into useful secondary streams.\n"
