description: A New Zealand wild game supplier offering ethically harvested meats - including wild tahr - linked to conservation and pest-control outcomes.
long_description: 'Premium Game supplies wild-harvested New Zealand game meats, working through a network of hunters and processors to bring hard-to-find proteins into kitchens without industrial farming inputs. Their tahr offering is rooted in the reality of Aotearoa''s alpine ecosystems: harvesting supports population control in sensitive high-country habitats where browsing pressure can impact native biodiversity. Expect genuinely wild provenance - animals feeding on natural alpine forage - and a supply model designed for chefs, butchers, and households seeking real, traceable wild food.
