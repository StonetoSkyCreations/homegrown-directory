long_description: |
  Terrace Edge is a family vineyard and olive grove on the terraces above the Waipara River in North Canterbury. The team tends hand-managed vines and olive trees on steep, free-draining soils, crafting small-batch wines and estate olive oil that reflect the site’s microclimate. Farming is guided by a focus on soil health and low-input stewardship suited to the dry, windswept hillside block. Produce is sold direct and through regional partners, with an emphasis on traceability from block to bottle.
