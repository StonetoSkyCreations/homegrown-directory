long_description: |
  Awaroa Organic Vineyard is a boutique, family-run vineyard and winery located in the Awaawaroa Valley near Onetangi Beach on Waiheke Island. Established in 1998, the vineyard operates as a cooperative enterprise formed by partners of Orapiu Grove Farm, with a shared goal of running a viable organic business while protecting and enhancing the surrounding land and ecosystems.

  The vineyard is certified organic and all viticulture and harvesting is carried out by hand. No synthetic chemicals are used. The land includes natural springs feeding into the Awaroa stream, areas of established bush including tōtara and kauri, and regenerating native vegetation. Vineyard management focuses on low yields, careful canopy control, and extended ripening to express the site’s clay-rich soils and warm, maritime climate.

  Awaroa specialises in premium red wines, particularly Syrah and Bordeaux-style blends, all made on-site using estate-grown organic grapes. Small quantities of organic olive oil, preserved olives, and skincare products made from on-site lavender are also produced. Due to the small scale of production, most wines are sold directly through the cellar door or online, offering visitors a close connection to the land, the wines, and the people behind them.
