  Ground Breaking Mushrooms is an urban mushroom farm and social enterprise based
  in New Plymouth, Taranaki, focused on producing fresh, edible mushrooms through
  circular, low-waste growing systems. The operation is built around a simple
  but powerful idea: turning local waste streams into high-quality food.

  The farm diverts approximately 35–40kg of spent coffee grounds each day from
  local cafés — including partners like Escape Coffee Roasters — preventing this
  organic material from going to landfill. These coffee grounds are blended with
  other organic secondary materials to form a nutrient-rich growing substrate,
  created using 100% organic principles.

  In contrast to conventional mushroom farms that rely on single-use plastic
  grow bags, Ground Breaking Mushrooms uses upcycled, food-grade Fonterra dairy
  buckets to house their substrate. This approach significantly reduces plastic
  waste while creating a durable, reusable growing system.

  Collection of coffee grounds is carried out using a zero-emissions e-bike and
  trailer in partnership with the Bishop’s Action Foundation (BAF), ensuring the
  operation remains low-carbon from input to harvest. Once mushrooms are
  harvested, the spent substrate enters its third life as high-quality organic
  compost, closing the loop on the original waste stream.

  The enterprise operates as a social enterprise in collaboration with the
  Bishop’s Action Foundation, with a strong focus on community food security,
  education, and practical climate action. Founder Matthew Williams regularly
  runs workshops at The Junction – Zero Waste Hub, teaching people how to grow
  mushrooms at home using repurposed materials such as hessian coffee sacks.

  Ground Breaking Mushrooms primarily grows Grey Oyster mushrooms, chosen for
  their flavour, texture, and versatility in cooking. These mushrooms are
  considered restaurant-quality, holding their structure well when cooked and
  offering a nutrient-dense, plant-based protein option rich in fibre and B
  vitamins.

  Fresh mushrooms are sold directly into the local food system, keeping supply
  chains short and transparent. They are available at the Taranaki Farmers
  Market, through local retailers such as Down to Earth Organics, and supplied
  directly to New Plymouth restaurants seeking sustainably grown, local
  ingredients.
