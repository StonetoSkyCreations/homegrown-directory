long_description: |
  Mercury Orchard is a small eco‑retreat on Purangi Road that combines country‑style self‑contained cottages with an organic mixed orchard and permaculture gardens. Guests stay among fruit trees and gardens designed to permaculture principles and are welcomed with complimentary seasonal fruit, teas and coffee from the orchard. The orchard is managed without chemicals and features a variety of heritage fruit trees, vegetables and herbs. The hosts share their local knowledge and encourage visitors to explore the gardens and learn about organic growing while staying close to iconic sites like Cathedral Cove and Hot Water Beach. Fresh produce is occasionally sold to guests and neighbours when in surplus.
