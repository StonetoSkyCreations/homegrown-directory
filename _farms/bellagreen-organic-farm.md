long_description: |
  Bellagreen Organic Farm is a certified organic market garden located in Drysdale, Victoria, on the Bellarine Peninsula. The farm is owned and operated by Riona Seehusen and was shaped by a philosophy grounded in connection to land, community, and long-term soil care.

  The farm grows seasonal vegetables for the local community, with soil health at the centre of all decisions. Bellagreen operates under a strict no-till system, avoiding soil disturbance to build structure, biology, and fertility over time. This approach supports nutrient-dense food production while protecting soil ecosystems.

  Produce is sold primarily through a flexible vegetable box subscription, allowing customers to customise their weekly selection, as well as through on-farm sales and local markets. Bellagreen also supplies other local stores and food businesses across the Bellarine region.

  The farm plays an active social role in the community, functioning as a gathering point for local families and emphasising direct relationships between grower and eater. Bellagreen operates with a local-first focus, supplying food close to where it is grown and strengthening regional food resilience.
