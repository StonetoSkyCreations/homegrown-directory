long_description: |
  Akarua is a vineyard and winery located in Bannockburn, near Cromwell, in Central Otago. Originally planted in 1996, the land was converted from farmland to vineyards, with Pinot Noir and Chardonnay as the first varietals established. The name Akarua, meaning “two vines” in te reo Māori, reflects these original plantings.

  The estate comprises approximately 34.5 hectares across the Cromwell Basin, with the majority located on Cairnmuir Road in Bannockburn. These north-west facing slopes are known for their balanced growing conditions, well-draining soils, and favourable airflow, supporting high-quality cool-climate viticulture.

  Akarua is part of the Edmond de Rothschild Heritage portfolio and produces wines exclusively from its own estate-grown grapes. The vineyard is in the process of converting to organic viticulture, with Biogro certification targeted for the 2026 vintage. Vineyard management incorporates regenerative practices including inter-row planting of legumes and flowers, sheep grazing, composting of grape skins, mulching, water-efficient underground irrigation, and biodiversity enhancement.

  Wines produced include Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Gris, and Rosé. Sales occur through the on-site cellar door, direct online sales, wine club memberships, and wholesale distribution within New Zealand and internationally.
