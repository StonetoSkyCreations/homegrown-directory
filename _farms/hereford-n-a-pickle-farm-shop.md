  Hereford 'n' A Pickle is a small farm shop and eatery run by the Donaldson family near Colville at the top of the Coromandel Peninsula. The owners raise Hereford cattle, pigs and hens on pasture and grow vegetables and fruit naturally on their farm. Visitors can stop at the roadside shop for beef and pork cuts, eggs, seasonal produce, house‑made burgers using 100% pure Hereford beef, coffee, real fruit ice cream and condiments. The shop also sells pantry staples, preserves and picnic supplies. They operate on sustainable principles, farming as naturally as possible and keeping their animals free‑range.
