  Let Food Be Thy Medicine Garden is a traditional whānau-based garden and trial cropping site located on a four-generational dairy and beef family farm in Kawakawa, Northland. The site centres around two large, traditional-style family vegetable gardens alongside trial paddocks used for experimenting with diverse crop mixes.

  The gardens primarily grow food for on-site use and local community engagement, including vegetables from the whānau gardens and trial plantings such as mixed grass species and sunflowers. Trial paddocks are also grazed by the farm’s dairy and beef cattle, integrating food production with existing livestock systems.

  The garden participates in the Northland Edible Garden Trail, opening to the public during scheduled events to share knowledge about traditional gardening methods, trial cropping, and family food systems. During open days, visitors may purchase produce, plants, seeds, and simple refreshments such as hot drinks and breakfast or morning tea items.

  The project is community-oriented and educational in nature, with proceeds from sales often supporting family or community fundraising initiatives. The garden reflects a wellness-focused philosophy grounded in family heritage, food knowledge, and hands-on learning.
