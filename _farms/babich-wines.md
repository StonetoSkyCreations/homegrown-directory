description: >
  Babich Wines is a family-owned vineyard and winery based in Henderson Valley,
  West Auckland, with a winemaking history stretching back to 1916. Founded by
  Croatian immigrant Josip Babich, the farm remains anchored on its original
  homestead and vineyards, now stewarded by the fourth generation of the Babich
  family. Babich grows and produces wines across Auckland, Marlborough, and
  Hawke's Bay, with a strong focus on long-term land care, soil health, and
  sustainable viticulture. The Henderson Valley site continues to operate as
  the company headquarters, cellar door, and bottling facility, and remains one
  of the last working vineyards in urban West Auckland. Babich is certified
  organic on select vineyards, with a commitment to expanding organic
  production, and uses practices such as cover cropping, composting grape skins
  back into the soil, underground irrigation, and biodiversity plantings. Their
  approach prioritises working with natural systems, minimising synthetic
  inputs, and maintaining consistent vineyard sites year after year to express
  place and continuity. Wines are estate-grown where possible and crafted with
  minimal intervention, reflecting a farm-first philosophy that places the
  vineyard at the centre of quality and character.
