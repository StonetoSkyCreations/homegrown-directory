long_description: |
  Bella Olea is a small, family-owned organic olive farm located on the outskirts
  of Greytown in the Wairarapa. Run by Chris and Hilary Penman, the grove is
  managed at a deliberately human scale, with a strong focus on soil health,
  biodiversity, and long-term care for the land.

  Across two grove sites, more than 2,000 olive trees are grown using certified
  organic, spray-free, and regenerative practices. Rather than relying on
  synthetic inputs, Bella Olea focuses on nourishing the soil through compost,
  mulch, and diverse ground cover, allowing healthy trees and high-quality fruit
  to emerge naturally from the system.

  All olives are hand-harvested and carefully crafted into premium extra virgin
  olive oils, including award-winning single-varietal and grove blends. In
  addition to olive oil, Bella Olea produces table olives, olive leaf tinctures,
  and a range of olive-based body care products, ensuring the harvest is used
  thoughtfully and with minimal waste.

  Bella Olea is deeply aligned with local food systems, selling directly through
  farmers' markets and encouraging circular practices such as jar returns to
  reduce waste. Their approach reflects a broader philosophy of stewardship:
  growing food slowly, respectfully, and in relationship with place.
