Bella Olea is a family-owned olive grove on the outskirts of Greytown. With just under 1,000 trees, the grove produces award-winning certified-organic olive oil along with table olives, body lotions, skin balms and olive leaf tincture. The olives are grown without synthetic chemicals, and the family manages the entire process from grove to bottle. Their oils – such as the Koroneiki single-variety and the blended Grove oil – have earned medals in national competitions.

Bella Olea also handcrafts skincare products using olive oil as a base, creating moisturising balms and lotions free from artificial additives. Customers can purchase their products through the grove's Facebook page or in Little Farms' pantry section. In addition to supplying Little Farms, the Penman family regularly participates in local olive festivals and welcomes enquiries via email or phone.
