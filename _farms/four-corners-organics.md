Established in 2008 by Jos and Rita Paans and now run alongside their son Hendrik, Four Corners Organics has been part of the Little Farms network from the start. The farm is Biogrow-certified and minimises its environmental impact through several innovative practices: they irrigate crops solely with rainwater, micro-irrigating to conserve water; generate as much electricity as possible with solar panels; and use only natural Biogrow-approved fertilisers. Crops are grown in unheated greenhouses to extend the season without burning fossil fuels.

Four Corners produces a range of vegetables throughout the year. Winter harvests include celery, broccoli and wombok cabbage, while summer brings juicy tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes. By combining ecological stewardship with careful crop planning, the Paans family delivers a steady supply of organic produce to Little Farms and local customers, proving that small-scale operations can be both environmentally responsible and commercially viable.
