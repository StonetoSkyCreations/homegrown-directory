  BROOMHILL Sanctuary is a community-led, regenerative land project based in Glenorchy, Aotearoa New Zealand, growing food and knowledge in an alpine, cold-climate environment. The project focuses on local food sovereignty, ecological care, and hands-on learning through seasonal participation.

  Food is grown using regenerative, organic principles and shared through a CSA-style model, where participation and financial contributions support the costs of growing, harvesting, and distributing food rather than purchasing produce. Produce is shared with participating households, stewards, and community members, guided by a living calendar that responds to seasonal conditions and land needs.

  The sanctuary also hosts short-term volunteers and WWOOFers, offering practical, land-based learning through gardening, harvesting, and stewardship activities. BROOMHILL is shaped by alpine conditions and a commitment to working with natural rhythms, community care, and long-term resilience for both people and land.
