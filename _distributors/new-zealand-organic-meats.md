long_description: New Zealand Organic Meats (NZOM) unites a community of organic farmers who share a commitment to ethical farming and environmental stewardship. Founded by Paul Ruddenklau and Neville Parkinson and now run by directors Quintin and Rebecca Hazlett, the company works with approximately forty farms to supply certified-organic beef and lamb. NZOM farmers manage their land holistically, prioritising animal welfare, soil health and water protection. The cooperative markets its meat domestically and internationally, meeting growing demand for chemical-free red meat and strengthening the organic sector. Headquarters are at Hukarere Station Road near Tapanui, where the team coordinates sales and liaises with producers.
