description: AFFCO's Free Farmed New Zealand Pork range offers high-quality pork products from pigs raised in free-farmed systems that allow sows and piglets outdoor access and humane living conditions.
long_description: Meat company AFFCO produces a range of pork cuts under its Free Farmed New Zealand Pork label for welfare-conscious consumers. Free-farming means sows farrow outdoors in shelters and piglets are free to explore and forage, rather than being confined in crates. AFFCO emphasises that free-farmed animals enjoy a natural diet, resulting in better meat quality, and that the system benefits farm ecosystems. The products are marketed for consumers seeking a guilt-free alternative to conventional pork and are available through retailers and online meat suppliers nationwide. AFFCO's corporate office and sales division are based in Horotiu, near Hamilton, where the company operates processing plants and manages farmer relationships.
