long_description: Founded in 2006 by a group of friends and farmers, First Light Farms raises Wagyu cattle and venison in New Zealand using a purely grass-fed, pasture-raised system. The company works with a network of farmers who manage some of the country's best grazing land to produce high-marbling beef and tender venison while prioritising animal welfare and environmental stewardship. First Light supplies premium meat to restaurants, supermarkets and consumers worldwide, offering complete traceability from farm to table. The head office is in Havelock North, where customers can contact them for wholesale or online orders. New Zealand's GMO-free status and strict animal management underpin their quality assurance.
