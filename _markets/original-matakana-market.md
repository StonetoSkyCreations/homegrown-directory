The Original Matakana Market is held inside and around the historic Old Dairy Factory, a building that has anchored the village since 1902. Running every Saturday from 9 am to 2 pm, the market invites visitors to explore a diverse array of art, crafts, clothing, antiques, collectables, produce and sweet treats. Stallholders set up both inside the restored factory and in the courtyard outside, creating a vibrant maze of treasures.

The market began in the early 1980s as a way for locals to share their creations and has grown into a beloved community tradition. Shoppers can browse handcrafted jewellery, pottery, textiles, vintage curiosities and original art, alongside fresh produce and homemade jams, cakes and pastries. Live music and family-friendly activities contribute to the relaxed atmosphere. Located at 30 Matakana Valley Road in central Matakana, the market retains the charming, old-fashioned feel of its setting while offering something new each week. Whether you're seeking a unique gift, a tasty treat or a stroll through local history, the Original Matakana Market delivers a memorable Saturday experience.
