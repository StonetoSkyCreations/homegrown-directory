long_description: |
  Brewtown Farmers Market is a vibrant weekly Sunday market held at the Brewtown
  complex in Upper Hutt, Wellington. With more than 80 rotating vendors, the market
  brings together fresh produce, artisan food, handcrafted goods, and ready-to-eat
  meals from a wide range of cuisines. While not positioned as a strictly certified
  organic or regenerative market, Brewtown Farmers Market strongly supports local
  growers, makers, and small businesses, many of whom operate with low-waste, ethical,
  or eco-conscious practices.

  The market is designed as a welcoming community hub, featuring a fully covered
  venue and seating area that makes it enjoyable in all weather conditions. Live music
  and a relaxed, family-friendly atmosphere add to its appeal, while its location
  within Brewtown—Wellington’s craft beer village—means visitors can easily extend
  their visit to nearby breweries, eateries, and entertainment venues. In recognition
  of its community impact, Brewtown Farmers Market was a finalist in the Wellington
  Gold Awards 2023 (Emerging Gold Services category).
