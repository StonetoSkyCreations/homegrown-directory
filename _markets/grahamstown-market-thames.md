long_description: |
  The Grahamstown Market, also known as the Thames Saturday Market, takes place every Saturday morning from 8 am in the heritage precinct at the northern end of Pollen Street. Stalls line the street selling locally grown fruit and vegetables, herbs, flowers and seedlings alongside handmade crafts, vintage goods and art. Food vendors offer bread, pastries, preserves, honey, pickles and ready‑to‑eat treats, and buskers add to the lively atmosphere. The market has operated for decades and draws locals and visitors who enjoy shopping for fresh produce and unique crafts while exploring the historic buildings. It generally runs until midday, though some stalls remain until early afternoon.
