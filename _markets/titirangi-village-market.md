long_description: |
  The Titirangi Village Market is a long-running monthly market held in the heart of Titirangi Village, bringing together over 100 independent vendors each month. Established in 1991 and run by parents as a fundraiser for the Titirangi Rudolf Steiner School, the market has become a deeply rooted part of the local community culture. Stallholders offer a diverse mix of food, fresh produce, arts and crafts, clothing, vintage items, gifts, and wellbeing products, alongside live music.

  The market takes place at the Titirangi Memorial Hall and carpark area, operating rain or shine from 10am to 2pm. It runs on the last Sunday of each month from February to November, and on the first and second Sundays in December, with no market held in January. New stallholders are welcomed regularly and can apply via the market’s Facebook page.
