  The Tairua Market takes place on the first Saturday of each month at the community hall from 9 am to 1 pm. Stalls offer fresh fruit and vegetables, homemade jams and chutneys, baking, free‑range eggs, seedlings, potted plants and handmade crafts. The market serves as a social gathering for the community and provides an outlet for small producers from Tairua and the wider eastern Coromandel. Visitors can enjoy a relaxed morning shopping and chatting with growers over coffee and snacks from the onsite café stalls.
