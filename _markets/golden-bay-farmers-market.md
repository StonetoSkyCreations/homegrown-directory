long_description: |
  The Golden Bay Farmers Market, also known locally as the Takaka Village Market, has operated since 2007 and is held on the Village Green in the heart of Takaka. It functions as a key gathering place for the Golden Bay community, offering locally grown food, handmade goods, and live music in a relaxed, open-air setting.

  The market places a strong emphasis on local, small-scale production, with many stallholders selling organic, biodynamic, or spray-free fruit and vegetables grown within the Golden Bay region. Produce is typically sold directly by the growers, creating transparency and direct relationships between producers and the community.

  In addition to food, the market showcases a wide range of handmade arts and crafts, including ceramics, jewellery, natural skincare products, recycled and upcycled clothing, and other locally made items. Musicians and buskers contribute to the market atmosphere, reinforcing its role as a social and cultural hub.

  While the primary focus is on locally grown food and handmade goods, the wider Golden Bay area has a strong culture of wild food knowledge. Guided foraging walks are offered locally, and wild-foraged products may occasionally appear at the market, depending on season and availability.

  The market runs weekly through the warmer months and transitions to a monthly schedule during winter. It welcomes both locals and visitors and is known for its friendly, inclusive, and relaxed community atmosphere.
