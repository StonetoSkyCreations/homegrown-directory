  Puriri Hall Market Day takes place on the last Saturday of each month from 8:30 am to 1 pm. Local stallholders sell plants, seedlings, home‑grown produce, fresh baking, preserves, crafts and second‑hand goods, and children enjoy face painting and games. The market serves as a fundraiser for community projects and provides a gathering place for residents of Puriri and surrounding rural areas. Food stalls and coffee carts make it easy to linger and chat with neighbours.
