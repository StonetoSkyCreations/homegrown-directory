The Matakana Village Farmers' Market is the beating heart of this coastal village. Open every Saturday morning from 8 am to 1 pm year-round, the riverside market invites visitors to start their day with award-winning coffee and gourmet brunch dishes. Stalls overflow with seasonal local produce, flowers, artisan breads, deli treats and sweet delights, all grown or made by passionate producers. Live musicians provide a laid-back soundtrack while children play in a rustic treehouse and natural playground.

Zero-waste principles underpin every aspect of the market—shoppers are encouraged to bring their own baskets and reusable bags. The sense of whānau (family) is strong here: stallholders happily chat about provenance, share recipes and foster a warm community vibe. Beyond food, the market features stalls selling honey, coffee, macadamias, smoked fish, charcuterie, pies, handmade products and more. A dedicated dog-minding service (Matakana Mutts) lets pet-owners browse at leisure, and the tree-shaded riverside area is perfect for picnics. Whether you're after a gourmet brunch, pantry staples, fresh flowers or simply a slice of small-town charm, the Matakana Village Farmers' Market offers an authentic taste of regional life.
