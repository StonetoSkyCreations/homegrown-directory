      <p>A quiet culture exists: people growing, sourcing, and serving food with care. Businesses with an emphasis on regenerative, organic, spray-free, wild, foraged and local food are all around us but often hard to find. Homegrown fixes this.</p>
      <p>Here is a map of relationships: growers, farmers, markets, grocers, cafés, and restaurants - all part of this growing community.</p>
      <p>Use the search bar to look up a place, business, product, or practice, or browse by region and category.</p>

        <p>We are in our beta phase. Finding all the people. Playing with funtion and form. If something’s missing, or a listing needs correcting, please send us an email:</p>
