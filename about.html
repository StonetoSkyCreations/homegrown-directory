    <h1>Food is a relationship, not a product.</h1>
    <p class="lead">Homegrown exists because food is more than a product. It’s a relationship—and a living loop of reciprocity between soil, plants, people, and place.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-hero__note">
    <p>Homegrown isn’t a marketplace. It’s a map of relationships—local growers, ethical retailers, farmers’ markets, cafés, and restaurants who keep integrity at the center.</p>
    <p class="muted">A living ecosystem, in digital form.</p>

    <h2>Why Homegrown exists</h2>
    <p>Across cultures and old traditions, Earth is understood as a living organism—constantly giving, receiving, cycling, and renewing. When we grow or gather food in integrity with that living system, we enter that same rhythm of reciprocity. Life feeds life. Soil feeds plant. Plant feeds people. People care for soil in return. The loop stays alive.</p>
    <p class="about-quote">Modern food systems broke that loop. They were built around extraction: <em>How much can we take? How little can we give?</em> The result is distance—between people and place, eaters and growers, story and source.</p>
    <p>Homegrown is a response to that distance.</p>

  <div class="about-highlight">
    <p class="about-highlight__title">A directory built for reciprocity</p>
    <p>Homegrown maps producers who grow with care, land-based practices that regenerate rather than deplete, and local businesses choosing transparency over convenience.</p>
    <p>It gathers farms, markets, food makers, cafés, restaurants, and ethical retailers into one place, so people can find food grown with intention—and the people behind it.</p>

    <h2>What we champion</h2>
    <ul class="about-list">
      <li><strong>To help people find real food.</strong> Food grown organically, regeneratively, spray-free, pasture-raised, wild, or in harmony with the land.</li>
      <li><strong>To help producers be seen without navigating extractive systems.</strong> Their story matters. How they grow matters. Integrity should be discoverable.</li>
      <li><strong>To reconnect eaters, growers, makers, and markets.</strong> Every listing is part of a small ecosystem: farms supplying restaurants, growers selling at markets, shops supporting local producers. The directory shows these relationships so the supply chain is no longer invisible.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote class="about-quote">Whether you come with a spiritual sense of Earth as kin, or simply want clean, trustworthy food for your household, the principle is the same: <strong>a healthy food system is built on reciprocity—giving as well as taking.</strong></blockquote>
