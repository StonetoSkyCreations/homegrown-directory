    <p class="eyebrow">About Homegrown Directory</p>
    <h1>Homegrown Directory is a searchable directory of farms, producers, markets, grocers, cafés, and restaurants across Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia.</h1>
    <p class="lead">Listings focus on food grown or sourced using organic, regenerative, spray-free, wild, or land-aligned practices, with a strong emphasis on local and community-based food systems.</p>
    <p>It exists to help people find food grown with care, close to home — and to make visible the relationships that support more resilient, place-based communities.</p>
    <div class="about-hero__note">
      <p><strong>Homegrown is a directory, not a marketplace.</strong> It does not sell food. It maps who grows food, how it’s grown, and how it circulates locally.</p>
      <ul class="about-hero__list">
        <li>Not a ranking system</li>
        <li>Not exhaustive</li>
        <li>Not an endorsement</li>

  <section class="about-section" id="why">
    <h2>Why it exists</h2>
    <div class="about-section__content">
      <p>Food is not just a product. It is a relationship between soil, plants, people, and place.</p>
      <p>Modern food systems have stretched that relationship thin. Long supply chains, centralisation, and scale-driven efficiency create distance between eaters and growers, towns and farms, story and source.</p>
      <p>Homegrown exists as a response to that distance, supporting local production and making it easier for people and businesses to support one another close to home.</p>

    <h2>Who is behind it</h2>
    <div class="about-section__content">
      <p>Homegrown began as a local response to the difficulty of finding good food close to home, and is growing carefully across regions while holding the same principles: locality, transparency, and relationship.</p>
      <p>The project remains intentionally ad-free and non-extractive, so communities are not treated as commodities.</p>

  <section class="about-philosophy" id="philosophy">
    <h2>Philosophy (context)</h2>
    <p>Across land-based cultures, Earth is understood as a living system — constantly cycling, feeding, and renewing.</p>
    <p>When food is grown and shared locally, in relationship with land and community, those cycles remain visible and alive.</p>
    <p class="about-philosophy__close">Whether approached through ecological science, lived experience, or simple practicality, the principle is the same: resilient food systems are built close to home.</p>
