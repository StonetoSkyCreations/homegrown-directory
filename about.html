    <p class="eyebrow">About Homegrown</p>
    <h1>Homegrown is a human-friendly directory for food grown with integrity.</h1>
    <p class="lead">Homegrown exists because food is more than a product. It’s a relationship, and a living loop of reciprocity between soil, plants, people, and place.</p>
    <p class="about-hero__note">Homegrown is a map of relationships. Local growers, ethical retailers, farmers’ markets, cafés, and restaurants who keep integrity at the center. <span class="muted">A living ecosystem, in digital form.</span></p>

    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <div class="about-section__content">
      <p>Modern food systems broke that loop. They were built around extraction: <em>How much can we take? How little can we give?</em></p>
      <p>The result is distance between people and place, eaters and growers, story and source.</p>
      <p>Homegrown is a response to that distance.</p>

    <h2>What makes Homegrown different</h2>
    <ul class="about-principles">
      <li><strong>To help people find real food.</strong> Food grown organically, regeneratively, spray-free, pasture-raised, wild, or in harmony with the land.</li>
      <li><strong>To help producers be seen without navigating extractive systems.</strong> Their story matters. How they grow matters. Integrity should be discoverable.</li>
      <li><strong>To reconnect eaters, growers, makers, and markets.</strong> Every listing is part of a small ecosystem: farms supplying restaurants, growers selling at markets, shops supporting local producers. The directory shows these relationships so the supply chain is no longer invisible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <div class="about-section__content">
      <p>Homegrown is a directory, not a marketplace.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-steps">
      <div class="about-step">
        <h3>What gets listed</h3>
        <p>Homegrown maps producers who grow with care, land-based practices that regenerate rather than deplete, and local businesses choosing transparency over convenience.</p>
        <p>It gathers farms, markets, food makers, cafés, restaurants, and ethical retailers into one place, so people can find food grown with intention and the people behind it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-step">
        <h3>Integrity signals</h3>
        <p>We surface how food is grown—organic, regenerative, spray-free, pasture-raised, wild—and who it connects to.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-step">
        <h3>Community visibility</h3>
        <p>Listings highlight the people, whakapapa, and land care behind every product so growers don’t have to trade integrity for reach.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-step">
        <h3>Relationship mapping</h3>
        <p>We show how farms supply restaurants, markets, and retailers, making the local supply chain visible.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-step">
        <h3>Human-friendly search</h3>
        <p>Designed to be simple to browse on mobile or desktop, with clear categories for groceries, eateries, markets, and farms.</p>

    <h2>The philosophy</h2>
    <div class="about-section__content">
      <p>Across cultures and old traditions, Earth is understood as a living organism, constantly giving, receiving, cycling, and renewing.</p>
      <p>When we grow or gather food in integrity with that living system, we enter that same rhythm of reciprocity. Life feeds life. Soil feeds plant. Plant feeds people. People care for soil in return. The loop stays alive.</p>
      <blockquote class="about-quote">Whether you come with a spiritual sense of Earth as kin, or simply want clean, trustworthy food for your household, the principle is the same: <strong>a healthy food system is built on reciprocity.</strong></blockquote>

    <h2>The invitation</h2>
    <p>Homegrown is built to honour local food cultures, ethical growers, and community-supportive businesses. It’s a map for people who care about where their food comes from and the people and places it sustains.</p>
    <p>This exists. If it is useful to you, you are welcome to use it.</p>
