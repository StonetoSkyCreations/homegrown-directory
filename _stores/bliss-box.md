Bliss Box (formerly Ooooby) is a family business created by Fraser and Viktoria Bliss after a health journey that led them to organic wholefoods. They took over the Ooooby organic food box service in 2018 and relaunched it as BLISS in 2025, celebrating real food and real life. The service partners with growers who share its values and delivers nourishing, organic fruit and vegetable boxes, meat, dairy, bakery goods and pantry items to homes in Auckland, Waikato, Tauranga and other North-Island areas. Bliss Box is committed to zero food waste, ordering extra produce so it can donate surplus fruit and vegetables to local missions and soup kitchens each week. It minimises packaging by using reusable delivery boxes, compostable bags for microgreens and paper tape, and offers same-day deliveries in Auckland with support for complex dietary needs. The company lists Streamside Organics among its farmers and artisans, highlighting the farm's regenerative organic practices.
