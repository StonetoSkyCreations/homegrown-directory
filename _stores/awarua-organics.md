  AwaRua Organics is a premium New Zealand organic dairy brand producing certified organic milk powders from grass-fed cows in Southland, operating under rigorous independent organic certification.
long_description: >
  AwaRua Organics is a New Zealand-owned organic dairy brand launched in 2019 by Open Country Dairy, one of the country’s largest independent milk processors and a subsidiary of the Talley’s Group. The brand was established following a multi-year conversion of selected Southland farms and the Awarua processing facility to meet strict organic certification requirements.
  
  All AwaRua Organics products are fully certified organic across the entire supply chain, from farm management and animal health through to transport, processing, and packaging. Organic milk is sourced from long-term contracted farms located close to the Awarua plant in Southland — one of the southernmost dairy-producing regions in the world — and is transported in purpose-built organic-only tankers to ensure segregation and integrity.
  
  Farming systems supplying AwaRua Organics are grass-fed and free-range, with cows living outdoors year-round and managed without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fertilisers, antibiotics, or GMOs. While the brand does not formally market itself as regenerative, its certified organic systems support soil health, water quality, biodiversity, and animal welfare, aligning closely with regenerative principles.
  
  AwaRua Organics focuses primarily on premium organic milk powders, including specialised nutrition products such as A2 protein powders, Mum2Be, and Toddler Plus formulations. The integrated processing model allows milk to be processed within hours of collection, preserving freshness and quality while maintaining full traceability back to certified organic farms.
