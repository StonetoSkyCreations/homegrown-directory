long_description: 'Bellbird Bakery in Merivale is the newest expression of this long-standing Christchurch bakery, offering sourdough bread, French pastries, and everyday food made with integrity. Using organic and spray-free Canterbury-grown flour, Bellbird continues its slow, fermentation-led approach that prioritises flavour, nutrition, and craft.

  Alongside breads and pastries, the Merivale shop serves fresh sandwiches and barista-made coffee, creating an accessible local hub for well-made food. As with all Bellbird locations, the emphasis remains on ethical sourcing, regional supply chains, and baking that respects both people and land.
