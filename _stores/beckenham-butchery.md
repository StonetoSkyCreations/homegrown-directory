Beckenham Butchery is a cornerstone of organic food culture in Otautahi Christchurch -- a fully certified organic butcher committed to ethical sourcing, whole-animal respect, and transparent origins. Located right next door to Untamed Earth Organic Grocer in Beckenham, it creates a rare pairing: organic meat and organic produce side by side. For customers, it means one simple thing -- you can complete your entire organic shop in one stop, confident that everything you are buying has been raised or grown with integrity.

The butchery has built its reputation on trust. People who choose organic meat do so because they care about what they put into their bodies and the impact their choices have on the land. Beckenham Butchery honours that commitment by keeping prices as fair as possible while upholding the highest standards of organic animal husbandry and processing. They work nose-to-tail, using and respecting the whole animal -- from premium cuts to bones for broth -- ensuring nothing is wasted and every part of the animal is valued.

Organic Beef

Beckenham Butchery sources its certified organic beef from Harris Farms, a long-standing BioGro-certified producer operating since 1956. Every animal is raised on pasture, free from synthetic chemicals, with a focus on soil health and long-term ecological stewardship.

Organic Lamb

Their lamb is sourced through New Zealand Organic Meats (NZOM), a network of 40 certified organic farmers united by a commitment to ethical, sustainable, and chemical-free animal rearing. NZOM livestock are grass-fed, raised without antibiotics or growth promoters, and grazed on land free of pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilisers. Each farm in the network is audited annually to ensure compliance with internationally recognised organic standards. The result is nutrient-dense, high-quality meat that reflects the ecology it came from.

Organic Chicken

Beckenham Butchery proudly stocks Bostock Brothers Organic Free-Range Chicken, a premium organic product meeting international welfare standards. Raised in the Hawke's Bay on organic apple orchards, Bostock birds roam freely among the trees, live in clean French-style mobile chalets, and are entirely free from antibiotics, hormones, GMOs, and chlorine processing. Their slower-growing, naturally raised flocks produce meat with superior texture, flavour, and nutrient density -- a hallmark of genuine organic farming.

A place for conscious food choices

Beckenham Butchery is more than a meat counter -- it is a community resource for people who value ethical sourcing, sustainable practices, and full transparency. Whether you are picking up a cut for dinner or stocking up on bones for nutrient-rich broths, every option available is certified organic and produced in alignment with regenerative land care.

Open seven days a week and offering both in-store shopping and nationwide delivery, the butchery makes high-quality organic meat accessible to households across Aotearoa. Paired with Untamed Earth next door, it offers Christchurch residents a rare opportunity: a complete organic food ecosystem within a few metres -- vegetables, fruit, herbs, bread, pantry staples, and ethically raised meat all in one naturally aligned hub.
