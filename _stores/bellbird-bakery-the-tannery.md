long_description: >
  Bellbird Bakery at The Tannery is the original home of this Christchurch-based artisan bakery, founded on a commitment to slow fermentation, traditional technique, and local sourcing. Breads and pastries are made daily using organic and spray-free flour grown and milled within Canterbury, with long natural fermentations that prioritise flavour, nutrition, and digestibility.

  From classic sourdough loaves to French viennoiserie, everything is made from scratch by a small team of dedicated bakers. Bellbird works closely with local growers and ethical suppliers, reducing food miles while supporting a resilient regional grain economy. The Woolston bakery remains a cornerstone of Bellbird’s craft-focused, community-minded approach.
