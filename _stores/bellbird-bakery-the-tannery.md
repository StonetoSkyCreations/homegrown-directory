description: Artisan sourdough bakery at The Tannery crafting organic and spray-free bread and French pastries using traditional methods.
long_description: "Bellbird Bakery at The Tannery is the original home of this Christchurch-based artisan bakery, founded on a commitment to slow fermentation, traditional technique, and local sourcing. Breads and pastries are made daily using organic and spray-free flour grown and milled within Canterbury, with long natural fermentations that prioritise flavour, nutrition, and digestibility.\nFrom classic sourdough loaves to French viennoiserie, everything is made from scratch by a small team of dedicated bakers. Bellbird works closely with local growers and ethical suppliers, reducing food miles while supporting a resilient regional grain economy. The Woolston bakery remains a cornerstone of Bellbird\u2019s craft-focused, community-minded approach.\n"
