long_description: 'Real Food Direct is a family-owned online wholesaler and retailer based in Picton, Marlborough, supplying wholefoods and pantry staples to households across Aotearoa. Founded around 2017, the business operates primarily through e-commerce, packing products to order and shipping nationwide, including rural addresses.

  The range spans organic and conventional pantry staples such as legumes, nuts, seeds, grains, baking ingredients, dried fruit, rice, milk alternatives, and supplements. Products that are certified organic are clearly labelled as such, while the business does not claim that its full range meets organic, regenerative, or spray-free standards.

  Real Food Direct operates as a distributor rather than a producer, sourcing products from a mix of local and international suppliers. This allows customers to access a broad selection of wholefoods in both small and bulk quantities, supporting cost savings and reduced packaging through less frequent purchasing.

  Goods are packed fresh to order, a key point of differentiation for the business. Packaging is designed to minimise environmental impact, with eco-friendly bags used where possible. The company operates under an approved New Zealand food safety programme and caters to a wide range of dietary needs, including gluten-free, vegan, and allergen-conscious customers.

  Within a food-integrity context, Real Food Direct fits as a transparent bulk retailer offering certified organic options alongside conventional products, with integrity determined at the individual product level rather than across the entire range.
