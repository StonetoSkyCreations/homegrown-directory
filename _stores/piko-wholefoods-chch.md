  Piko Wholefoods is a Christchurch wholefood store founded in March 1979, originating from the Peterborough Street Community Living Project and a wider movement for urban self-sufficiency. It was conceived by a group including Rod Donald, Hans and Janice Schaeper, and Keith and Pauline Whiting, with early produce grown locally in the Avon Loop area.

  The store operates as a workers' co-operative under the Te Whānau Trust and follows a low-profit model focused on accessibility rather than growth. Decision-making is shared among staff through a consensus-based structure, and surplus profits are donated to community organisations aligned with social and environmental wellbeing.

  Piko became Christchurch's first BioGro Certified Organic retail store in 2014. After the original building was destroyed in the 2011 earthquakes, the store rebuilt on its original Kilmore Street site, reopening in 2015 in a purpose-designed building incorporating solar energy and sustainability principles.

  The store is strictly vegetarian and centres its offering on bulk wholefoods and fresh organic produce. Core products include grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, herbs, spices, bulk liquids, and seasonal fruit and vegetables. Many items are sold unpackaged to reduce waste and support container reuse.

  Piko also stocks a wide range of gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, and sugar-free foods, while maintaining a simple, wholefood-first approach to nutrition. The on-site Piko Kitchen produces house-made foods including muesli, nut butters, hummus, gluten-free baking, and plant-based meals.

  Piko Wholefoods prioritises local, certified organic, and ethically sourced products, supporting both New Zealand producers and long-standing fairtrade supply partners. Customers are encouraged to bring their own containers and bags, with reuse and waste reduction embedded in daily operations.
