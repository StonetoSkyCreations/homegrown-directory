long_description: Food Forest Organics is a farm shop and plant-based cafe founded
  by Suzy Amis Cameron and the Cameron family in Greytown's Main Street. The shop
  sources organic vegetables, fruits and herbs from the Camerons' regenerative farm
  and other local growers and sells organic pantry goods, breads, preserves and sustainable
  household products. The cafe serves vegetarian and vegan dishes made with seasonal
  produce, and customers can relax in a garden setting behind the shop. The business
  promotes ecological practices and healthy living, reinvesting profits into educational
  programmes and food forest projects. Open most days, Food Forest Organics also offers
  online ordering and produces a range of frozen meals.
