long_description: Food Forest Organics is a farm shop and plant-based cafe founded by Suzy Amis Cameron and the Cameron family in Greytown's Main Street. The shop sources organic vegetables, fruits and herbs from the Camerons' regenerative farm and other local growers and sells organic pantry goods, breads, preserves and sustainable household products. The cafe serves vegetarian and vegan dishes made with seasonal produce, and customers can relax in a garden setting behind the shop. The business promotes ecological practices and healthy living, reinvesting profits into educational programmes and food forest projects. Open most days, Food Forest Organics also offers online ordering and produces a range of frozen meals.
