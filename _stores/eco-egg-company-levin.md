long_description: "The Eco Egg Company Ltd is a long-established New Zealand producer of certified organic, free-range eggs, operating in association with Zealand Farms. Registered in 1993, the business has become known for its commitment to verifiable organic standards, high animal welfare, and transparent production systems.\nThe company\u2019s Bio Eggs are independently certified organic by AsureQuality, a New Zealand government-owned certification body. This certification governs the entire production system, including organic feed inputs, housing, outdoor access, flock size, and animal health practices. Hens are fully free-range, with continuous access to pasture where they can forage, dust-bathe, and express natural behaviours.\nStrict stocking limits are a defining feature of the operation, with low indoor and outdoor bird densities and capped flock sizes to reduce stress and improve animal wellbeing. All organic feed is certified organic, free from synthetic pesticides, GMOs, antibiotics,\
  \ and growth promoters, and the feed mill itself is independently accredited.\nWhile the business does not explicitly market itself as regenerative, its pasture-based systems, tree planting for shade and shelter, and emphasis on soil and animal health align with many regenerative and ethical farming principles. The strength of Eco Egg Company lies in its independent third-party verification, providing consumers with confidence that organic and free-range claims are audited, enforced, and traceable.\n"
