long_description: "Harbour Co-op (formerly LyttelPiko) is a low-profit, community-owned\
  \ wholefoods shop established after the 2010 earthquakes by locals who wanted a\
  \ dedicated neighbourhood hub for organic, fair trade, and wholefoods. Owned by\
  \ households, employees, and institutional purchasers, the co-op is committed to\
  \ keeping mark-ups low on organic food, minimising waste through bulk buying and\
  \ reusable containers, and actively supporting local makers and suppliers. Anyone\
  \ can shop here, with the option to become an owner-member by purchasing a share\
  \ and joining the co-operative community. Volunteering is also welcomed as part\
  \ of the co-op\u2019s wider kaupapa of connected, healthy communities and a lighter\
  \ ecological footprint.\n"
