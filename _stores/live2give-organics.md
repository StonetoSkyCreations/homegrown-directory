Live2Give Organics operates as an online organic grocer, supplying customers with produce from its own regenerative farm alongside trusted partners like Streamside Organics. Customers can order individual organic fruit and vegetables or subscribe to set boxes, with deliveries made in chilled trucks between Palmerston North and Wellington and courier shipping nationwide. A swap-a-crate system keeps local deliveries low-waste, while the team maintains transparency about where each item is grown. The shop offers seasonal fruit and vegetables, organic eggs, dairy and tofu, and pantry staples including grains, nuts, seeds, pulses, and flour.

Live2Give’s online shop is fed by their own farm operation — see their farm listing at [Live2Give Organics farm](/farms/live2give-organics/).
