long_description: |
  The Bread Social Byron Bay is an artisan bakery founded in 2015 by bakers Tom Scott, Sam Saulwick, and Paul Giddings. The bakery operates on-site at The Farm at Byron Bay in Ewingsdale, New South Wales, and forms part of a broader working farm and food hub.

  The bakery specialises in naturally leavened sourdough bread and pastries made using long fermentation and traditional baking techniques. A single loaf of sourdough is prepared over approximately 72 hours, with an emphasis on time, process, and skill rather than speed or volume.

  Ingredients are sourced from Australian producers wherever possible, including organic flour suppliers such as Woods Organic, Wholegrain Milling, and Kialla Organics. Being located on a working farm allows the bakery to access some ingredients directly from the surrounding market garden when available.

  The Bread Social places strong value on transparency, craftsmanship, and community connection. In addition to daily baking, the business shares knowledge through sourdough classes and workshops, supporting local food education and skills.

  The Byron Bay bakery operates as one of several locations, while remaining closely integrated with the regenerative and educational environment of The Farm.
