In the heart of Christchurch’s SALT District — a pocket of grit, creativity, and post-quake reinvention — sits Bohemian’s City Bakery Cafe. It’s where the craft of slow-fermented sourdough meets the energy of an evolving urban neighbourhood.

The pastries and breads come from the same foundation as all Bohemian locations: long, cool fermentations; Canterbury-grown flours from Milmore Downs and Farmers Mill; real ingredients sourced from local producers including Thulani eggs, Heathcote honey, Prima and AllPress coffee roasters, and a suite of small Aotearoa drink makers.

City Bakery Cafe is lively and communal. Musicians play live every Saturday from 10am–1pm, and the space fills with brunch-goers, workers escaping their offices, and locals who treat the cafe as a dependable ritual. Inside, you’ll find signs in Czech and Slovak nodding to the bakery’s roots; outside, a small garden softens the industrial lines of the district.

The food is simple and generous: pastries warm from the oven, sandwiches, toasties, pies, vegetarian and plant-based options, and loaves baked that morning. Drinks range from espresso to Wildwood’s specialty hot chocolates to Hakanoa elixirs, with Karma and Chia Sisters rounding out the cold selection.

This location is spirited, social, and expressive — a true city bakery with the soul of a village one.
