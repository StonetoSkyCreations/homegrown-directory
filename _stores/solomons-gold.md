long_description: >
  Solomon’s Gold is a New Zealand-based, award-winning bean-to-bar chocolate maker specialising in high-integrity, single-origin chocolate crafted from organically grown cacao sourced directly from the Solomon Islands.
  
  The business operates as a vertically integrated social enterprise, controlling the entire supply chain from cacao tree to finished chocolate bar. Its parent company, C-Corp, was established in the Solomon Islands in 2006 to rebuild the country’s cacao industry through ethical trade, local ownership, and sustainable agricultural practices. The Solomon’s Gold brand and New Zealand chocolate factory followed around 2013, bringing the full bean-to-bar process to Aotearoa.
  
  Cacao is sourced from more than 100 village grower groups across the Solomon Islands, where cacao trees are grown in biodiverse, low-intervention environments using traditional farming methods passed down through generations. All cacao is certified organic, meaning it is grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or chemical fertilisers. Through C-Corp, growers receive training, infrastructure support, and micro-financing, and are paid premium prices for their beans.
  
  Chocolate is handcrafted in Mount Maunganui, where beans are roasted, stone-ground, conched, tempered, and hand-wrapped on site. This full bean-to-bar control ensures exceptional quality, complete traceability, and transparency at every stage of production.
  
  Solomon’s Gold chocolate is free from dairy, gluten, nuts, soy, and refined sugars, and is independently tested for heavy metals, with results showing “not detected”. Laboratory testing has also demonstrated high levels of naturally occurring antioxidants, magnesium, and zinc compared with conventional chocolate.
  
  As a values-driven business, Solomon’s Gold operates as a social enterprise prioritising ethical sourcing, environmental care, and community wellbeing. Packaging is transitioning toward fully home-compostable materials as part of an ongoing commitment to reducing environmental impact.
