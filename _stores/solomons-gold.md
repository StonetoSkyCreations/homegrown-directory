long_description: "Solomon\u2019s Gold is a New Zealand-based, award-winning bean-to-bar chocolate maker specialising in high-integrity, single-origin chocolate crafted from organically grown cacao sourced directly from the Solomon Islands.\nThe business operates as a vertically integrated social enterprise, controlling the entire supply chain from cacao tree to finished chocolate bar. Its parent company, C-Corp, was established in the Solomon Islands in 2006 to rebuild the country\u2019s cacao industry through ethical trade, local ownership, and sustainable agricultural practices. The Solomon\u2019s Gold brand and New Zealand chocolate factory followed around 2013, bringing the full bean-to-bar process to Aotearoa.\nCacao is sourced from more than 100 village grower groups across the Solomon Islands, where cacao trees are grown in biodiverse, low-intervention environments using traditional farming methods passed down through generations. All cacao is certified organic, meaning it is grown\
  \ without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or chemical fertilisers. Through C-Corp, growers receive training, infrastructure support, and micro-financing, and are paid premium prices for their beans.\nChocolate is handcrafted in Mount Maunganui, where beans are roasted, stone-ground, conched, tempered, and hand-wrapped on site. This full bean-to-bar control ensures exceptional quality, complete traceability, and transparency at every stage of production.\nSolomon\u2019s Gold chocolate is free from dairy, gluten, nuts, soy, and refined sugars, and is independently tested for heavy metals, with results showing \u201Cnot detected\u201D. Laboratory testing has also demonstrated high levels of naturally occurring antioxidants, magnesium, and zinc compared with conventional chocolate.\nAs a values-driven business, Solomon\u2019s Gold operates as a social enterprise prioritising ethical sourcing, environmental care, and community wellbeing. Packaging is transitioning toward fully home-compostable\
  \ materials as part of an ongoing commitment to reducing environmental impact.\n"
