description: Tiny organic sourdough bakery in Takaka crafting stoneground bread and pastries from locally grown and milled grain.
long_description: 'Bacca Bakery is a small, organic sourdough bakery tucked behind the Telegraph Hotel in Takaka, Golden Bay. Run by owner-bakers Gregor and Chris, the bakery is built around a deep commitment to flavour, nutrition, and locality, using organic, stoneground grains with some wheat grown just kilometres from the oven. All breads and pastries are naturally leavened and made slowly by hand, often following multi-day fermentation schedules that bring depth, texture, and digestibility.


  Everything is made from scratch using organic ingredients, from sourdough loaves and rye brownies to laminated pastries and savoury pies. Bacca works closely with local farmers and producers, helping revive grain-growing in Golden Bay and creating one of the shortest field-to-oven supply chains in the country. The bakery operates very much "for locals, by locals," selling out regularly and maintaining a warm, transparent connection with its community.
