long_description: |
  Soul Food Organic is a boutique organic grocery and wholefoods store located in Frankton, Queenstown, with roots that trace back over 20 years to its beginnings as a small organic shop in Wānaka. The store centres its work on real food, human connection, and supporting local food systems through careful sourcing and in-store preparation.

  The shelves prioritise certified organic and spray-free produce, with a strong emphasis on New Zealand-grown food to reduce food miles and support regional growers. Alongside fresh fruit and vegetables, Soul Food Organic stocks pasture-raised meats, local venison, cold-smoked salmon, bone broth, heritage seeds from Koanga Gardens, and a range of pantry and body-care products selected for ingredient integrity.

  Many items are prepared in-house, including fresh juices and smoothies made to order, activated nuts, and hand-rolled organic treats known as “Soul Bites.” The store also receives fresh sourdough from FlourBro Sourdough and carries locally made specialty foods from Otago and the lower South Island.

  Owned and run by Paul O’Hara, Soul Food Organic operates as both a grocery store and a community space, where relationships with customers and suppliers are treated as central to the business. Regular offerings include curated family fruit and vegetable boxes and local delivery across Queenstown Lakes, Central Otago, and Southland. The store also supports low-waste shopping through bulk options and practical guidance on caring for organic food at home.
