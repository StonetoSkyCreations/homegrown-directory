long_description: "Ashley River Organics is a certified organic orchard located on\
  \ the banks of the Ashley River in Loburn, North Canterbury. The orchard was originally\
  \ established in 1966 and was purchased by owners Mark and Annabelle in 1990. After\
  \ acquiring the property, they began transitioning the land to organic production,\
  \ completing the certification process in 2008 following a three-year conversion\
  \ period.\nToday, the orchard grows more than 20 varieties of apples and pears,\
  \ including both heritage and modern cultivars. All certified produce is grown without\
  \ synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilisers, in line with BioGro New Zealand\
  \ standards and AsureQuality certification requirements. Orchard management focuses\
  \ on soil health, ecological balance, and long-term sustainability.\nA defining\
  \ feature of Ashley River Organics is its commitment to minimising waste. Fruit\
  \ that does not meet cosmetic standards is diverted into producing 100% premium,\
  \ not-from-concentrate juices, ensuring the harvest is fully utilised. This zero-waste\
  \ approach supports both environmental responsibility and product integrity.\nProduce\
  \ and juices are sold directly through local farmers\u2019 markets, including the\
  \ Christchurch Farmers\u2019 Market and Opawa Farmers\u2019 Market, as well as via\
  \ selected organic retailers. Customers are able to meet the growers directly, creating\
  \ transparency and trust within the local food system.\n"
