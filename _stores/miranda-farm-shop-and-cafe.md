  Miranda Farm Shop & Café is a friendly farm‑gate stop on the Shorebird Coast. The shop and small café serve Millers Coffee organic blend and Green Valley Dairy organic barista milk and stock Phoenix Organics juices and Nice Blocks frozen treats. Visitors can buy Harney & Sons teas (organic where possible) along with homemade jams, jellies and sauces made from fruit harvested on the farm. The property’s vegetable beds and fruit trees are managed organically, and the owners grow seasonal produce used in dishes and sold in the farm shop. Seating is available for coffee and snacks, and guests can browse the small farm shop for preserves and gifts. The contact page lists the address, phone and email for enquiries.
