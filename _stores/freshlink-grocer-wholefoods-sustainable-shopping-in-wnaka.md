long_description: |
  Freshlink Grocer is an independent wholefoods grocer based in Wānaka, founded by Jesse and shaped by a background in rural self-sufficiency and market gardening. The store was born from a school economics project in 2017 and has since evolved into a community-focused food hub centred on access to real kai with minimal processing.

  The core aim of Freshlink is to reduce the distance between producer and consumer. The store prioritises sourcing from local and New Zealand–based growers and makers wherever possible, stocking seasonal produce, free-range eggs, locally produced meats, and pantry staples selected for ingredient integrity. Organic options are offered when available, alongside wholefoods chosen for their simplicity rather than dietary labels.

  Freshlink places strong emphasis on waste reduction and low-impact shopping. Much of the fresh produce is sold without packaging, milk is available in returnable glass bottles, and customers are encouraged to bring their own containers. The store includes extensive refill sections for grains, flours, herbs, spices, oils, vinegars, and household cleaning products, with meat wrapped in paper rather than plastic.

  All products are carefully vetted to exclude artificial preservatives, stabilisers, sulphites, anti-caking agents, and refined sugars, with the guiding principle that food should remain close to its natural form. Unsold organic food and by-products are diverted to a local worm farm and compost system, returning nutrients to the soil through nearby farming operations.

  Freshlink also operates alongside the Dripping Bowl, a neighbouring café that uses ingredients from the store to prepare acai bowls, smoothies, and wholefood meals, allowing customers to experience the quality of the produce in prepared form. Together, the two spaces function as both a grocer and a community meeting point, grounded in traditional food values, transparency, and care for local food systems.
