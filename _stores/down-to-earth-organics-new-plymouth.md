  Down to Earth Organics has been part of the Taranaki community since 1979,
  earning its place as the region’s original organic shop and a trusted hub for
  holistic health and sustainable living. Founded by Dave Marshall and Keith
  Plummer, the store was built on a simple but enduring mission: to provide
  genuinely clean, ethical, and sustainably produced food and natural products
  that support both personal wellbeing and long-term care of the environment.

  Over four decades on, Down to Earth Organics has grown into a true one-stop
  organic supermarket. The store stocks fresh organic produce, organic meats,
  wholefoods, plant-based alternatives, supplements, bespoke herbal remedies,
  sustainable cleaning products, clean beauty, personal care, and eco-focused
  homewares — all curated with intention rather than trend.

  A defining feature of Down to Earth Organics is its uncompromising approach to
  sourcing. As demand for “natural” products has increased, so too has
  greenwashing across the industry. Every supplier is carefully vetted against
  the store’s high ethical, environmental, and social standards, and one of their
  qualified health practitioners personally checks every product before it
  reaches the shelves to ensure it meets strict “clean” criteria.

  Local sourcing is prioritised wherever possible, with a strong focus on
  producers based around Mount Taranaki (the Maunga) and across Aotearoa.
  Notable local offerings include natural honey harvested in the Kaitake Ranges
  by co-founder Keith, fresh organic produce from Kaitake Farm, artisan bread
  from Bumblebee Bakery, and wāhine-led natural skincare brands such as Everkind
  and Tuttofare Beauty. The store also supports small-batch, wild-foraged and
  handcrafted makers like Woodsy Botanics.

  Sustainability is woven through the customer experience. Down to Earth
  Organics operates a bulk refillery station for foods and household products,
  maintains jar and bottle libraries to support reuse, and offers a welcoming
  in-store café corner serving organic drinks and nourishing treats. Qualified
  naturopaths are often on hand to provide personalised advice and support,
  alongside an extensive in-store herbal dispensary.

  Today, Down to Earth Organics continues as an intergenerational Taranaki icon —
  independent, community-rooted, and quietly rigorous in its standards. Whether
  you are deeply immersed in organic living or just beginning your journey, the
  store meets people where they are and walks alongside them toward a more
  natural, sustainable way of life.
