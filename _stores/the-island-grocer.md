long_description: >
  The Island Grocer is a family-operated deli/grocery in the heart of Oneroa, created for conscious eaters who want quality food with clear provenance. The shelves lean heavily toward organic and spray-free fruit and veg, with a strong Waiheke thread running through the store—local pantry goods, island-made specialties, and seasonal seafood when available. Alongside everyday provisions you’ll find daily bread from island bakers, ready-to-eat meals for easy weeknights, fair trade beverages and snacks, and a thoughtful range of wines and craft beers that includes Waiheke producers. It’s a practical “larder-up” stop that supports local makers while keeping good organic staples on hand.
