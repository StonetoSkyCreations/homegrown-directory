long_description: |
  The Wilderland Organics Shop is a volunteer-run roadside stop on State Highway 25 in Kaimarama, between Coroglen and Whitianga. Operating since 1964, it is the public-facing shop for the Wilderland Trust, selling goods grown and handcrafted on-site by residents and students.

  Shelves focus on minimally processed, organic products: 100% raw, unfiltered multifloral honey (meadow and premium Manuka) hand-poured to preserve natural enzymes, seasonal fruit such as avocados, mandarins, grapefruit, and kiwifruit picked daily from the orchard, plus herbal teas, tinctures, ointments, handmade soaps, and candles. Pantry staples include preserves, vinegars such as plum and apple cider, and locally made chocolate.

  The shop is generally open daily from 10am to 3pm (as of 2026), with wheelchair access and onsite parking. All proceeds support the Wilderland Charitable Trust, funding community education and regenerative land stewardship. An online store is also available for those outside the peninsula.
