long_description: "Ramharter Biodynamic Farm is a small-scale market garden located\
  \ in Ladbrooks, Canterbury, near Christchurch, and is closely associated with grower\
  \ Rainer Ramharter. The farm is known locally for producing high-quality seasonal\
  \ vegetables using biodynamic principles\u2014an approach to agriculture that treats\
  \ the farm as a self-sustaining living organism.\nFarming practices at Ramharter\
  \ go beyond standard organic methods. Synthetic fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides\
  \ are avoided entirely, with soil fertility instead built through composting, crop\
  \ rotation, cover cropping, and biodynamic preparations. Planting and harvesting\
  \ are informed by lunar and seasonal calendars, a core feature of biodynamic agriculture,\
  \ with the intention of strengthening soil life, plant vitality, and overall ecosystem\
  \ health.\nProduce from the farm is sold directly into the local food system, including\
  \ through farmers\u2019 markets such as the Mount Pleasant Farmers\u2019 Market\
  \ and via community-focused retailers like Harbour Co-op in Lyttelton. The emphasis\
  \ is on freshness, locality, and transparency, with vegetables grown specifically\
  \ for the Canterbury region rather than long-distance distribution.\nWhile formal\
  \ biodynamic certification (such as Demeter) is not publicly confirmed, the farm\u2019\
  s practices align closely with biodynamic and regenerative principles. Ramharter\
  \ Biodynamic Farm is regarded as part of Christchurch\u2019s grassroots organic\
  \ food network, contributing to resilient local supply chains and healthier soils.\n"
