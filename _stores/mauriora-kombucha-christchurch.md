description: "Wh\u0101nau-owned Christchurch kombucha producer brewing traditional kombucha with organic ingredients, grounded in M\u0101ori values of wellbeing, integrity, and connection to whenua.\n"
long_description: "Mauriora Kombucha is a wh\u0101nau-owned and operated kombucha producer based in \u014Ctautahi Christchurch. Founded in 2018, the business grew from a much longer personal fermentation journey that began over nine years earlier with the gifting of a SCOBY. The name \u201CMauriora\u201D reflects a M\u0101ori concept of wellbeing, life force, and vitality, which sits at the heart of the brand\u2019s philosophy.\nBrewing is carried out using traditional kombucha fermentation methods, with an emphasis on care, patience, and nurturing living cultures. Mauriora uses filtered water, organic green and black tea (t\u012B), and raw organic cane sugar as its base ingredients. Some varieties include local honey for Jun-style kombucha, and native or locally significant ingredients such as kawakawa and ginger.\nThe business places strong emphasis on Te Ao M\u0101ori values, including tikanga M\u0101ori, whanaungatanga (relationships), and respect for Papat\u016B\u0101nuku (the earth).\
  \ These principles guide not only how the kombucha is brewed, but also how the business engages with community and wellbeing. Kombucha is framed as a living food that supports hauora \u2014 physical, emotional, and spiritual health.\nWhile Mauriora clearly states that organic ingredients are used, no specific third-party organic certification body is publicly referenced. The integrity of the product is instead communicated through transparency, cultural grounding, and close control of the brewing process.\nMauriora Kombucha is expanding its physical presence, with a dedicated brewery and cellar door opening at 17 Dorset Street, Christchurch, scheduled for Spring 2025.\n"
