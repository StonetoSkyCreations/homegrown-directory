St Martins is Bohemian Bakery’s neighbourhood hub — a friendly corner stop positioned beside New World and moments from Hansen Park, where dog-walkers, families, and commuters drift through from dawn to afternoon.

Fresh sourdough, pastries, pies, toasties, and sandwiches arrive daily from the Bohemian kitchens, all built on the same integrity-based foundation: slow fermentation, Canterbury-grown flour, free-range eggs from Thulani, local honey, ethical meat suppliers, and small NZ beverage makers whose values align with Bohemian’s own.

St Martins brews C4’s Krank blend, giving this location its own distinct flavour profile — a darker, richer companion to the morning pastry run. There’s outdoor seating for those passing through on foot or with prams, and plenty of space for a quick grab-and-go visit while doing the grocery shop next door.

Desserts line the cabinets: eclairs, tarts, cakes, and seasonal specials that often sell out by mid-afternoon. Despite being one of the newer Bohemian sites, it already feels embedded — the kind of place where staff know regulars by name and where community happens naturally through everyday ritual.
