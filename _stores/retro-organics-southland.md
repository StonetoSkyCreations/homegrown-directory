long_description: 'Retro Organics is a pioneering certified organic dairy producer based in Tuturau, Southland, owned and operated by Robin and Lois Greer alongside their family. The Greers began transitioning their farm to organic management in 1998 after questioning the health and environmental impacts of conventional dairy farming. Following a decade-long commitment to organic principles, they established an on-site dairy factory around 2008, creating a fully vertically integrated, farm-to-plate operation.

  All Retro Organics products are made exclusively from milk produced by their own herd of approximately 300 organic Jersey cows. This single-farm sourcing model provides complete traceability, with milk processed almost immediately after milking by being pumped directly from the dairy shed into the on-site factory. This short, controlled supply chain preserves freshness, quality, and nutritional integrity.

  The farm is fully certified organic, meaning pastures are free from synthetic fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides, GMOs, and routine antibiotics. Jersey cows are intentionally chosen for their efficiency, calm temperament, and the naturally higher butterfat and protein content of their milk, resulting in creamier dairy products.

  Retro Organics is known for innovation within organic dairy, including being the first producer in New Zealand to create certified organic lactose-free milk and yoghurt. Their product range also includes distinctive savoury yoghurts and a variety of organic cheeses, reflecting a philosophy of simple, traditional food made with modern care and transparency.
