Taste Nature is one of Ōtepoti Dunedin’s cornerstone organic hubs — a place where food, wellbeing, and community are held together under one roof. For more than three decades, it has operated as a locally owned, socially conscious business committed to supporting sustainable living and strengthening the relationship between people and the land.

The store combines an organic wholefoods supermarket, a refill and zero-waste section, an organic café, and an integrative health clinic. Much of Taste Nature’s identity is shaped by its owners, Clinton Chambers and Rodney McDonald, whose organic gardens in Waitati continue to influence the values and practices behind the business. Their approach prioritises low-impact, chemical-free food, responsible consumption, and products that support both personal and environmental health.

Taste Nature identifies as a Māori business and aligns its operations with Te Whare Tapa Whā, the Māori holistic model of wellbeing. This framework shapes every aspect of the organisation — from sourcing policies and product selection to the way staff, practitioners, and customers are supported. The emphasis on taha tinana (physical health), taha hinengaro (mental health), taha wairua (spiritual health), taha whānau (collective wellbeing), and whenua (connection to land) gives Taste Nature a unique and grounded approach to environmental and community care.

Inside the store, customers will find organic produce, bulk refillery essentials, wholefoods, sustainable household goods, and natural personal-care products. The adjoining café offers simple, nourishing meals made from organic and locally sourced ingredients. Upstairs, the Health Clinic hosts a range of practitioners — including naturopaths, herbalists, counsellors, and massage therapists — offering support aligned with natural and integrative health principles.

Taste Nature’s guiding purpose is not profit maximisation but contribution: strengthening local food systems, reducing environmental harm, and empowering people to make conscious, sustainable choices. Its team aims to foster an inclusive, values-driven environment where small, consistent actions — choosing organic, supporting local producers, reducing waste — accumulate into meaningful change for people and planet.

You can also visit the neighbouring café, [Taste Nature Kitchen]({{ '/restaurants/taste-nature-kitchen-dunedin/' | relative_url }}), for seasonal organic meals and coffee alongside the grocer.
