long_description: "South Lea Olive Oil is a family-owned olive grove and producer\
  \ located on the northern banks of the Rakaia River in Canterbury. Owned and operated\
  \ by Peter and Frances Baylis, the seven-hectare property was purchased in early\
  \ 2005 and includes established olive trees planted prior to their ownership. Frances\
  \ has a personal connection to the land, having grown up in the area.\nThe grove\
  \ focuses on producing high-quality extra virgin olive oil using careful, low-intervention\
  \ growing and harvesting practices. Several Tuscan olive varieties are grown, including\
  \ Leccino, Frantoio, and Pendolino. Trees are pruned to encourage airflow and sunlight,\
  \ supporting wind pollination and reducing disease pressure.\nOlives are harvested\
  \ in June during clear winter conditions and are transported for pressing within\
  \ twelve hours of picking. This rapid harvest-to-press process is central to maintaining\
  \ oil quality, freshness, and low acidity. The oil is grown, pressed, and bottled\
  \ locally in Canterbury, ensuring a short and transparent supply chain.\nSouth Lea\u2019\
  s olive oil is independently tested each year by Olives New Zealand and meets the\
  \ chemical and sensory standards required for certification as Extra Virgin Olive\
  \ Oil. This allows the use of the OliveMark, a recognised quality assurance mark\
  \ within the New Zealand olive industry.\nWhile the grove does not publicly claim\
  \ organic or regenerative certification, its emphasis on local production, freshness,\
  \ and careful grove management has earned it a strong reputation for quality. South\
  \ Lea Olive Oil has received multiple awards through Olives New Zealand competitions\
  \ and is sold directly to customers and through selected farmers\u2019 markets across\
  \ Canterbury.\n"
