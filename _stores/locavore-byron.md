long_description: >
  Locavore Byron is a butcher and retail store founded in 2020 by Georgina Goddard and Morgwn Wilkie of Brooklet Springs Farm. Located in the Byron Bay Arts and Industry Estate, the store was created to support a more seasonal, ethical, and sustainable way of consuming meat within the local community.

  Brooklet Springs Farm began in 2016 after the founders moved from the city to regenerate their farmland and regain access to truly clean, nutrient-dense protein. Starting with small-scale pasture-raised poultry, the farm grew into one of Australia’s largest pasture-raised chicken producers, supplying local farmers markets and direct farm gate customers.

  Locavore Byron extends this farm-to-plate model by offering a seasonal range of pasture-raised organic and regenerative meats including chicken, beef, pork, lamb, and game. The core supply comes from Brooklet Springs Farm, with additional products sourced from other local organic farming families who share aligned values around animal welfare, soil health, and regenerative land management.

  All animals are raised in pasture-based systems without synthetic fertilisers, pesticides, GMOs, or routine antibiotics. Cattle are 100 percent grass-fed and grass-finished, raised slowly over extended timeframes to support animal health and flavour development. The business encourages nose-to-tail eating and offers a wide range of cuts including organ meats to support whole-animal use.

  Locavore Byron operates both as a local butcher shop and an online retailer, supplying customers across the Northern Rivers and the eastern seaboard. The focus remains on transparency, seasonal eating, and supporting farming systems that actively regenerate land and communities.
