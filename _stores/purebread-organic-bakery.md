long_description: "Purebread Organic Bakery is a pioneering New Zealand bakery and the country\u2019s first BioGro-certified organic bread producer. The bakery achieved BioGro certification for both its products and bakehouse in August 1996, establishing a national benchmark for organic baking in Aotearoa.\nThe business was originally founded as a family-owned operation after the founder was inspired by a Country Calendar episode on organic farming. That early commitment shaped Purebread\u2019s long-term philosophy: that organic agriculture is essential for human health, soil health, and community wellbeing. The bakery has since been acquired by Shelly Bay Baker, another respected producer of authentic organic sourdough, ensuring continuity of values and methods.\nAll Purebread products are certified organic under BioGro certification (#611), meaning every ingredient is non-GMO and free from synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and artificial additives. Organic certification extends to the\
  \ bakehouse itself, ensuring integrity across the entire production chain.\nBaking methods emphasise traditional slow fermentation and sourdough techniques, producing bread that is easier to digest and rich in flavour. In addition to wheat-based breads, Purebread is widely recognised for its extensive gluten-free range, which prioritises nutritional integrity by using real, whole ingredients such as organic potatoes, corn, and buckwheat rather than refined starch substitutes.\nIngredients are sourced with a focus on sustainability and transparency, including organic grains that are stoneground fresh and organic eggs from pasture-fed hens. The bakery\u2019s long-standing commitment to organic production and sustainable business practices has been recognised nationally, including receiving the Sustainable Business Network\u2019s Sustainable Business of the Year award.\nBased on the Kapiti Coast, Purebread Organic Bakery distributes nationwide through its online store, providing fresh delivery\
  \ across Aotearoa.\n"
