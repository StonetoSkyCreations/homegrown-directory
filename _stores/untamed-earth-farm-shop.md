The Untamed Earth Farm Shop in Beckenham is a neighbourhood hub for fresh, seasonal, organically grown produce -- located right next door to the Organic Beckenham Butchery. Together, the two create a rare pairing in the city: certified organic vegetables and ethically raised organic meat available side by side, making it easy for customers to shop with integrity in one stop.

The shop is an extension of Untamed Earth's soil-first farming philosophy. Stocked daily with produce grown across their 60 acres of organic market gardens in Otautahi, the shelves reflect what the land is offering in real time: crisp greens, staple vegetables, seasonal fruit, fragrant herbs, and speciality crops you will not find in supermarkets. Everything grown by Untamed Earth is certified organic (AsureQuality #1238), harvested fresh, and handled with minimal storage to preserve flavour and nutrient density.

Beyond their own harvest, the shop offers a curated selection of complementary goods -- including freshly baked bread, spray-free or organic fruit from trusted growers, and other local products that fit their standard of transparency and sustainable farming. Whether you are grabbing a few essentials or gathering ingredients for the week, the aim is simple: make fresh, local, organic food easy to access.

Customers can walk in anytime during opening hours, place phone orders for quick pickup, or even have their items delivered. The shop functions as both a retail space and a direct point of connection between the growers and the community. Staff know the farm, know the crops, and can tell you what is tasting best, how to store it, and how the season is unfolding.

Strong community relationships are central to the space. Many regulars visit both the shop and the nearby Beckenham Butchery, appreciating the shared commitment to organic standards and local sourcing. The shop also complements Untamed Earth's presence at farmers' markets across the city, offering a consistent seven-day access point for high-quality organic produce.

At its heart, the Untamed Earth Farm Shop is a simple offering done well: honest food, grown with care, sold by the people who understand the land it came from -- and made accessible to the Christchurch community every day of the week.
