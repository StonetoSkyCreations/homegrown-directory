long_description: |
  Blue Mountain Butchery is a locally owned specialty butchery based in Tapanui,
  West Otago, opened in 2017 by Vaughn and Shelley Wesselson. Set within a
  restored historic brick building that once housed the Lischner family
  butchery, the shop continues a long tradition of rural craftsmanship while
  reshaping it for a more transparent, values-led food system.

  Deeply embedded in the West Otago farming community, Blue Mountain Butchery
  operates with a paddock-to-plate philosophy. Vaughn Wesselson, a former
  nutrition specialist and local dairy farmer, brings a detailed understanding
  of animal nutrition, genetics, and pasture health into the careful selection
  of livestock.

  A defining feature of the butchery is its commitment to certified organic
  beef, including West Otago Organic Beef using Avalon genetics. Animals are
  raised on organic, spray-free farms where soil health, pasture diversity, and
  animal welfare are prioritised. Key supplier relationships include organic and
  regenerative farms such as Hukarere Station (via Meat With Us), where Planned
  Adaptive Grazing is used to regenerate soils and landscapes.

  Blue Mountain Butchery also provides home-kill services for local farmers,
  allowing animals to be processed directly from the farm. This reduces
  transport stress, supports meat quality, and strengthens local food
  sovereignty by keeping processing close to the land.

  Alongside fresh cuts, the butchery is known for award-winning deli meats and
  handcrafted sausages, made in small batches using gluten-free ingredients and
  traditional techniques. Delivery services are available to Alexandra and
  Dunedin on select days, extending access to locally raised, organic meat
  beyond the district.

  Blue Mountain Butchery stands as an example of how regional butcheries can
  play a vital role in reconnecting consumers with farmers, landscapes, and the
  full story behind their food.
