Beach Road Milk Co's farm gate kiosk is an honesty-based stop for locals picking
up raw A2 milk straight from the farm. The self-serve fridge is stocked daily,
and the gate sales focus on simple, no-fuss access to fresh milk without
processing or extra miles. Alongside milk, the kiosk brings together a small
mix of local staples like eggs, seasonal vegetables, bread, and honey from
nearby growers, making it an easy community pickup point in Omata.
