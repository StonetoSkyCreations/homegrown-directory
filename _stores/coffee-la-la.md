long_description: |
  Coffee LaLa is a boutique, award-winning roastery tucked in a bush-clad valley at Kuaotunu on the Coromandel Peninsula. Founded by Mark and Nedilka in 2002, it blends “art and science” in a former pottery shed, roasting 100% Arabica beans from respected plantations around the world. Each origin is roasted on its own to coax out terroir-driven flavour, then carefully blended into balanced, full-bodied coffees that have earned 18 New Zealand Coffee Awards.

  The roastery’s signature lineup ranges from La More — an intense, urban-style dark blend led by French-roasted Kenyan beans — to the Green Spot Organic, whose South American and East Timor beans fund Coromandel Watchdog’s anti-mining work. Oooh Lala delivers a Colombian, Ethiopian and nutty trio; Lala ‘30’ is dialled for classic 30 ml short blacks; and Lalabye decaf offers 97% caffeine-free comfort via a chemical-free water process.

  While Coffee LaLa is a roastery rather than a café, you’ll taste it across the Coromandel at spots like Kua Kawhe in Kuaotunu, Mei’s Café and Artisan Bakery in Coromandel Town, and the Waterworks Cafe. Beans are stocked at local grocers and specialty stores, and nationwide delivery gets fresh roasts to customers in one to three days. The team offers full cafe support — from equipment sourcing and setup to maintenance and training — all while staying rooted in the native bush and birdlife that surround their Wharekaho Road base.
