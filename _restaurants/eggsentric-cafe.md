long_description: 'Eggsentric Cafe is a long-established eatery nestled across the estuary from Whitianga at Flaxmill Bay. Its menu changes with the seasons and draws on local suppliers, with free-range eggs, organic milk, grass-fed meat and vegetables sourced from nearby growers. The kitchen offers vegetarian and gluten-free choices and makes cakes, breads and desserts in house. The business has introduced waste-reduction measures, including a mug library for takeaway drinks and recycling initiatives. Open for brunch and evening meals, it provides a sociable gathering place for residents and visitors and hosts live music events in its courtyard.
