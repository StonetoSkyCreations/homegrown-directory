  Tairua Beach Club is a contemporary eatery overlooking the harbour on Paku Drive. Chef Graeme Riki sources as much local produce as possible, working directly with growers and fishers and ensuring he knows where his ingredients come from. The menu changes frequently to reflect what is in season and features sustainable seafood, free-range grass-fed meats and organic vegetables. The restaurant is part of the international Slow Food movement and aims to showcase the flavours of the Coromandel while supporting ethical producers.
