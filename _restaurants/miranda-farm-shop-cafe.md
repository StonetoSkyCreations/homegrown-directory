  Miranda Farm Shop & Cafe sits on a family orchard overlooking the Firth of Thames. The cafe serves Millers organic coffee with organic Green Valley milk and offers Harney & Sons teas, Phoenix Organics juices and Nice Blocks and Little Island coconut ice cream. Visitors can purchase seasonal fruit, jams and baked goods made with produce from the farm’s organically managed vegetable beds and fruit trees. The property is run using organic practices, and customers can wander through the orchard while enjoying light meals and picnic platters.
