long_description: 'Ahi is a flagship expression of modern New Zealand dining, co-owned by chef Ben Bayly and hospitality professional Chris Martin. Located in Commercial Bay overlooking the Waitemata Harbour, Ahi is designed as a love letter to Aotearoa - celebrating land, sea, people, and place through food. The menu is shaped by a strong commitment to ethical, sustainable sourcing and proudly names the regions and producers behind each key ingredient. Ahi''s own Kitchen Garden in Patumahoe supplies a significant portion of the restaurant''s organic vegetables, grown using regenerative practices to prioritise flavour, soil health, and seasonal diversity. In the kitchen, fire plays a central role, with dishes often cooked over open flame and informed by both Maori techniques and contemporary culinary craft. Expect a dining experience that feels immersive yet approachable, where thoughtful service, provenance-led storytelling, and carefully selected New Zealand wines come together to reflect
  the richness of local food culture.
