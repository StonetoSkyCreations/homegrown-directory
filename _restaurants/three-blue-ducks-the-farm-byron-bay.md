long_description: |
  Three Blue Ducks Byron Bay is part of the Three Blue Ducks restaurant group and is located at The Farm at Byron Bay in Ewingsdale, New South Wales. The restaurant opened in 2014 and operates within an 80-acre working farm that grows produce and raises animals used directly in the kitchen.

  The business was founded by chefs Mark Labrooy, Chris Sorrell, and Sam Reid-Boquist, later joined by Darren Robertson and Jeff Bennett. The group began in Bronte in 2010 with the intention of creating food that sits between casual dining and fine dining while maintaining strong ethical and environmental values.

  At the Byron Bay site, the restaurant sources a significant portion of its vegetables, herbs, eggs, and meat directly from the surrounding farm and associated on-site producers. This creates a close connection between growing, cooking, and eating, with minimal food miles for many ingredients.

  Menus are designed around what is available seasonally and locally, with an emphasis on organic, spray-free, grass-fed, and pasture-raised produce where possible. Waste reduction is integrated into operations through composting, whole-animal use, and collaboration with suppliers who use reusable or returnable packaging.

  Three Blue Ducks Byron Bay operates as both a restaurant and a produce store, forming part of a wider food and education hub that invites visitors to see how food is grown, prepared, and shared.
