Black Estate is a family-run winery with three hillside vineyards certified both organic and biodynamic. The award-winning lunch restaurant showcases the estate's wines alongside dishes created with local and organic ingredients from North Canterbury farms, reflecting a deep commitment to regenerative farming and seasonal cooking. Guests can book a table Thursday to Monday from 11:30am to 3pm, while the cellar door is open daily 10am-4pm for tastings and light snacks. Private tours and group dining are available, and a studio B&B on the home vineyard invites visitors to stay among the vines.
