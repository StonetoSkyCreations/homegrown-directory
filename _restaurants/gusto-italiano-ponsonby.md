long_description: 'Gusto Italiano is a long-standing Italian restaurant at Three Lamps
  in Ponsonby, offering a relaxed neighbourhood dining experience centred on traditional
  Italian food. The menu focuses on wood-fired Roman-style pizzas and handmade pasta,
  with dishes prepared simply to let quality ingredients speak for themselves. Freshness
  and seasonality guide the kitchen, with local New Zealand produce used alongside
  carefully selected Italian imports such as San Daniele prosciutto, specialty cheeses,
  and traditional flours.


  The restaurant balances authenticity with locality, pairing classic Italian techniques
  with ingredients sourced close to home wherever possible. Vegetarian, vegan, and
  gluten-free options are available, reflecting an inclusive approach without compromising
  tradition. Run by owner Amando, Gusto Italiano maintains the feel of a true Italian
  trattoria - unfussy, welcoming, and rooted in consistency rather than trends.
