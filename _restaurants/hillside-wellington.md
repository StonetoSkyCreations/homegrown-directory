description: Small Wellington restaurant offering seasonal, plant-focused tasting menus inspired by what is grown, foraged, and available locally.
long_description: 'Hillside is a small, intimate restaurant in Thorndon, Wellington, serving set multi-course menus shaped by the seasons, their own garden produce, and foraged ingredients. The food is entirely meatless and plant-focused, with a full vegan menu always available when requested at the time of booking. Menus are not published in advance, allowing the kitchen to respond directly to what is fresh and available.


  The drinks list features exclusively New Zealand producers, with all wines being vegan-friendly and all non-alcoholic beverages made in-house. Wine and non-alcoholic matching options are available with dinner. With only 22 seats, Hillside operates by online booking and offers early and extended dining sittings from Tuesday to Sunday evenings.
