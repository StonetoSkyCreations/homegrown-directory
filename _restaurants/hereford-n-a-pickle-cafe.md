long_description: "Hereford 'n' A Pickle Cafe sits beside the family\u2019s farm shop north of Colville and turns their home-grown ingredients into simple, hearty meals. The kitchen grills 100% pasture-raised Hereford beef burgers, uses free-range eggs and vegetables grown on the property, and pours coffee and real fruit ice cream for travellers heading toward Port Jackson. Picnic supplies, cabinet baking and seasonal produce are available alongside hot food, and guests can see the paddocks that supply the menu just beyond the fence. By cooking with their own meat and produce, the cafe gives visitors a clear farm-to-plate link to the Hereford 'n' A Pickle herd and gardens next door.\n"
