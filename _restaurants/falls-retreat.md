long_description: 'Falls Retreat sits near the Owharoa Falls on the Coromandel peninsula and centres its menu on produce grown in its own organic vegetable gardens. The kitchen prepares food from scratch, including sourdough pizzas baked in a wood-fired oven, slow-cooked meats, garden salads and hearty platters. Visitors are encouraged to wander through the organic veggie beds, and the menus change frequently to showcase seasonal harvests and preserve excess as pickles and relishes. The relaxed venue operates as a restaurant, wedding venue and cooking school, embodying a paddock-to-plate philosophy in a stunning rural setting.
