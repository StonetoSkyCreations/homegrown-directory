description: All-day seafood-focused restaurant in Britomart celebrating sustainably sourced kai from Aotearoa's oceans, rivers, forests, and farms.
long_description: 'Kingi is an all-day restaurant in the heart of Britomart, grounded in a deep respect for Aotearoa''s land and sea. Named after kingfish, the menu centres on sustainably caught seafood alongside thoughtfully sourced meat, vegetables, and foraged ingredients that reflect place and season. Kingi works directly with independent fishers, divers, farmers, hunters, and growers, often naming suppliers and methods on the menu to honour transparency and stewardship.


  From early-morning coffee through to relaxed dinners, the food is prepared in ways that let ingredients speak for themselves - fresh, restrained, and quietly inventive. Located within the award-winning, Green Star-certified Hotel Britomart, Kingi also offers a private dining space where seasonal tasting menus showcase some of Aotearoa''s most respected producers in a more intimate setting.
