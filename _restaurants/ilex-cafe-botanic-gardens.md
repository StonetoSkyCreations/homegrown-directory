Set within the Christchurch Botanic Gardens, Ilex Cafe is a spacious, glass-walled eatery where floor-to-ceiling windows frame views of lawns and palm-filled nursery beds. The kitchen follows a "from garden to plate" philosophy, with chef-driven menus based on produce grown and sourced locally and changing with the seasons. Guests can dine indoors or enjoy a large outdoor area surrounded by nature, and the space also doubles as a venue for weddings, conferences and special events. Seasonal hours run 9am-4pm in winter and 9am-5pm in spring and summer, and a resident event team can tailor celebrations.
