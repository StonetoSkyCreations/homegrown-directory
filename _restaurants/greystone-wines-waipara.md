Situated in the rolling hills of Waipara, Greystone is a 100 percent certified-organic vineyard known for its sustainable viticulture. The cellar-door restaurant, led by Executive Chef Cameron Woodhouse, offers a la carte lunches and a Trust the Chef tasting menu that change weekly to showcase North Canterbury's bounty; ingredients are grown, foraged or raised nearby to harmonise with Greystone's wines. The venue also hosts wine tastings, cheese flights and private events, and is open Thursday to Monday from 11am to 4:30pm. Visitors can book tastings or larger gatherings via the cellar-door team.
