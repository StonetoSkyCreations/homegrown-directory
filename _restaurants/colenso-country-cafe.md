long_description: 'Colenso Cafe sits within a small orchard on the highway between Tairua and Whitianga. The owners cultivate mandarins, figs, plums, feijoas, apples, pears, persimmons, loquats, olives, lemons, herbs and vegetables using permaculture principles and harvest produce for the cafe. Visitors enjoy breakfasts, lunches and cakes made with this home-grown produce alongside Atomic coffee, T-leaf teas and Belgian hot chocolate. Excess fruit is turned into chutneys, relishes and preserves sold through the onsite store, and free-range hens roam the grounds. With vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options and sourdough baked most days, Colenso offers a true garden-to-plate experience.
