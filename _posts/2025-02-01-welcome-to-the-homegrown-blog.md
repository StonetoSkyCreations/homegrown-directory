Kia ora and welcome! We built Homegrown Directory to make it easier to find food that’s grown with care for soil, animals, and people. This blog will:

- Share quick guides on organic, regenerative, spray-free, biodynamic, and agroecological practices.
- Spotlight markets, farms, and hubs that are transparent about how they grow, harvest, and trade.
- Celebrate community projects that turn surplus into nourishment and keep good food local.
- Help eaters, chefs, and retailers link back to the producers behind every crate and loaf.

We’ll keep posts practical and uplifting, and we’ll link to the farms, markets, and stores featured so you can connect directly. If you have a story idea, email us at kiaora@homegrowndirectory.com. Mauri ora!
