Streamside Organics is a Canterbury-based organic farm built around a simple but often forgotten idea: food should be grown for people, not systems.

Founded by Logan Kerr and Dominique Schacherer, Streamside began as a backyard project and has since grown into a well-established organic operation supplying seasonal vegetables to households and markets across the region. Their work is grounded in soil health, seasonal awareness, and a deep respect for the land that feeds their community.

Rather than chasing scale for its own sake, Logan and Dominique have focused on building a food system that remains human in size and intention. Their approach prioritises working with natural cycles, cultivating healthy soils, and growing food that reflects the realities of place, climate, and season.

Vegetables are grown organically and distributed through direct relationships — including home delivery boxes and local markets — helping people reconnect with where their food comes from and how it is grown. Customers are invited into that learning process, gaining a clearer sense of what grows well in Canterbury, and when.

At its core, Streamside Organics represents a values-led model of food production: one that resists industrial shortcuts, honours ecological limits, and keeps the relationship between grower, land, and eater intact.
